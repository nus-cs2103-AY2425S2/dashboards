In the lecture, an empty dotted line is added if the method has no return value.
May I check if:
1. the dotted arrow is needed for void methods
2. If (1) is yes, am I able to explicitly state `void` as shown in the picture. This void is partially due to Mermaid formatting.

I have two questions for the sequence diagram lecture this week.
1. Why do we use items and value as the variable name? Shouldn‚Äôt it be empty since it is not explicitly stated but only part of the unwrapping process? (The variable names are also self determined)
2. Why is the return type Item when the return type of Order.getItems() is ArrayList&lt;Item>

> [@terryasdf](https://github.com/terryasdf) Hey there! I was told by Prof Akshay that Coursemology uses Java 11, which led to `toList` being an invalid method called on a `Stream`. I instead used `.collect(Collectors.toList())` (don't forget to import `Collectors`) and it now works! Assuming you were using similar logic to me, it should execute correctly. Hope this helps!

Oh I did not use streams and filter for this task. I have no idea what caused this, but I passed the test after replacing the files with the one from the 2113 website. Thank you for your comment tho.

IMO throw checked exceptions (inherited from Exception class while not RuntimeException) for your case. Exceptions are for cases when something stops your program from acting normally. For example if the user provides a invalid cmd input, your program cannot run that command correctly by any means, and an exception can be thrown.

On the other hand, if you have intended behavior for a invalid input, just use if/else. E.g. If your program replaces all invalid negative input values with zeros, then use if/else, because negative values are not "anomalies" that stop your program in this case.

This is my personal understanding.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Coursemology not passing Q9 and Q10 for Homework 2**
</div>

Hi, Coursemology isn't passing my answers for Q9 and Q10. I'm using streams in both answers so I'm wondering if that's the issue with my code because I'm not aware of any restrictions that we have for Coursemology. Just pasting the relevant parts of each answer:

Question 9:

'''Main.java
public static String[] filterEmails(String[] items) ``{``
    List&lt;String> filteredItems = Arrays.stream(items)
            .filter(str -&gt; str.contains("@"))
            .toList();

    return filteredItems.toArray(new String[0]);
``}``

public static void printItems(String[] items) ``{``
    System.out.println(Arrays.asList(items));
``}``
'''

Question 10:

'''Main.java
public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
    // ...

    line = in.nextLine();

    List&lt;String> amountStrings = Arrays.stream(line.split(" "))
        .filter(str -&gt; str.contains("$"))
        .toList();

    System.out.println("Expenses in overseas currency:" + amountStrings);

    double totalAmount = amountStrings.stream()
        .map(str -&gt; str.replace("$", ""))
        .mapToDouble(str -&gt; Double.parseDouble(str) * 1.70)
        .reduce(0.0, (acc, elem) -&gt; acc + elem);

    System.out.println(String.format("Total in local currency: $%.2f", totalAmount));
    in.close();
``}``

> 
> [@vegetablestabber](https://github.com/vegetablestabber)

@okkhoy Hi Prof, swapping the `println` statements with `print` statements has not changed anything unfortunately. I switched `println("Some string")` with `print("Some string\n")`, which resulted in no change. More specifically:

**Q9:**
_Before:_ `System.out.println(Arrays.asList(items))`
_After:_ `System.out.print(Arrays.asList(items) + "\n")`

**Q10:**
_Before:_ `System.out.println(String.format("Total in local currency: $%.2f", totalAmount))`
_After:_ `System.out.print(String.format("Total in local currency: $%.2f", totalAmount))`

I've even used a [text comparison tool](https://text-compare.com/) which tells me that the results are identical for all public test cases for Q9 and Q10.

@terryasdf Hey there! I was told by Prof Akshay that Coursemology uses Java 11, which led to `toList` being an invalid method called on a `Stream`. I instead used `.collect(Collectors.toList())` (don't forget to import `Collectors`) and it now works! Assuming you were using similar logic to me, it should execute correctly. Hope this helps!

Fixed this issue by replacing `.toList()` with `.collect(Collectors.toList())` (don't forget to import `Collectors`). Apparently, Coursemology uses Java 11, an earlier version of what this course encourages to use, which resulted in my code being invalid.

Sorry for the late reply, but looking at this now, I'm not sure what seems to be an issue. According to Prof Akshay, Coursemology runs on Java 11 but I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with your code. I know we're on Week 6 Coursemology practice problems now, but I think you could benefit with a discussion with either your TAs or Prof Akshay.

If you're past this problem, please close this issue, thanks!

However, what will happen to both me and the dev's bug accuracy after I state in disagreement that I want to change to "Medium" instead (simply because their error causes misunderstanding in diagram and should be at Medium at least and definitely must make changes)?

I want to ask more on how severity level can be seperated from each other in FeatureFlaw and DeveloperGuide

1. For incorrect notation for Diagram (eg: use of incorrect notation like the one mentioned in the announcement, using some wrong notation for graph such as wrong notation for frame/ mistake return arrow to be straight line like calling arrow), will these issues be considered as MEDIUM or LOW (this can be 1 mistake in a whole diagram, but do you consider them as minor convenience or actually more serious one).
2. Can you explain more on how to differentiate between HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW and VERY LOW severity in Feature Flaw (as the current instructions only say how it creates inconvenience in using, but not much on relevancy for feature flaw). In addition, do you have any tips when looking for feature flaw, as how can quickly indicate feature laws and their severity as well.

Can I check if teacher's decision on bug's severity must be either same as tester/ dev or they can have their own position. And in the case I change my severity at this phase (eg: from High to Medium), will their final position still be based on my initial position anymore (eg: High, given Dev's choice is Low)

Refer to:

2. [Adding SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) 

I think this will probably fix your issue. You may need to restart your device after the set up first.

In the FAQ regarding alternatives to PlantUML, it is mentioned that we should:

_**"Choose a diagramming tool that has some 'source' format that can be version-controlled using git and updated incrementally"**_

My team is considering using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to draw sequence and class diagrams. The tool generates `.drawio` files, which contain 400+ lines per diagram. 

Given this, would it be necessary to commit these files to our project repository?

Could we create a shared drive link instead with all our source files and attach the link in the DG instead of committing them to our project repository?

@vegetablestabber 

I was using this in my priority.java file 

```
public enum Priority ``{``
2 | HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW;
3 | ¬†
4 | //@Override
5 |     public String toString() ``{``
6 |         return this.name();
7 |   ``}``
8 | ``}``
9 | ¬†
```

and then I was simply calling it in my main code like this 



```
2 | ¬†
3 | // Add your method here
4 | public static void describe(String s, Priority p ) ``{``
5 | System.out.printf("%s indicates %s priority \n", s, p.toString().toLowerCase());
6 | ``}``
7 | ¬†
8 | public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
9 | describe("Red", Priority.HIGH);
10 | describe("Orange", Priority.MEDIUM);
11 | describe("Blue", Priority.MEDIUM);
12 | describe("Green", Priority.LOW);
13 | ``}``
14 | ``}``
15 | ¬†

```

This problem got solved when I removed the toString() method and instead used a switch-case in main.java

**1. :fas-info-circle: Tagging appropriately for iP**
</div>

I was checking the iP dashboard and realized that I haven't been creating tags for the commits I made for each week, so it appears that I have not made reasonable progress to the project. I have everything tagged on my local IntelliJ and they all show as normal when I use `git tag`, but I was wondering if there is a standard procedure from there to sync it to my github repo? 

I have read through the instructions on how to do so as well, but could not really understand how. Please let me know how I can be more specific about this, and I really appreciate your help!

Yes, but this pops up and stops me from doing so. This also appears whenever I want to push my commits via terminal, so I usually only use the commit tool on the side bar:

Hi guys, if you guys have this issue, you can try what I did to solve it (Thank you Mr GPT)

Apparently different OS has different line endings (LR and CRLF, you can search for what it is, idk also)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/345be5df-bbab-4af8-84b1-1cf46313ba01)

So when you try to run the runtest.sh or runtest.bat your test case will fail.

You need to install something via MINGW (I ran this command: pacman -S dos2unix)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feac17ff-510a-4ced-8900-bcfe36add097)

Then you can either use dos2unix or unix2dos to convert the line endings of EXPECTED.txt or ACTUAL.txt

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e29b716-b515-4ba3-b995-e983f425e439)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6284b813-261c-4a8c-96c3-5a37302c483d)

Afterwards it passed my local test and the github check. I hope you guys don't need to go through this

**1. :fas-info-circle: automated text UI mismatch error**
</div>

Hi all, my team has been experiencing this error for a few days now. When running the checks on Github, this error appears when running runtest.sh on Linux. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec22bd1f-05f7-430c-88c3-f0a4d54051d6)

From the picture, the actual and the expected output are identical. We have also looked at the text files multiple times on IntelliJ and found no leading or trailing spaces present. We also find it very odd that all the lines are failing.

Furthermore, I have run the runtest.sh locally on the Git terminal in Sourcetree. From the picture below, the test passes on my local machine. This makes me even more confusing that it passes locally, but not on the Github checks.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/079fac09-5dd8-4e36-a418-05b4b6675ed6)

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!

Thanks for your input. After looking through what you mentioned about the different line endings, I did more research and found out that the absence of the dos2unix command in the virtual machine that runs the Github checks is rather significant. That is why the test cannot pass, as the absence of dos2unix command means that the expected text file could not convert to the same format as the actual text file. With the difference between Windows and Linux in how they interpret the end of a line, the two text files will actually be different, despite visually looking the same.

After doing more research, I found a solution to this problem. I edited the runtest.sh file to replace dos2unix with something else that does not require installation. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956ef604-6b07-47c2-9d1b-363d14d3dbce)

This helped to convert the EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT and ACTUAL.TXT to the same format for comparison during the automated text UI test. Thus, the test is now satisfactory.

Thanks again for the help!

1. Program crashes if command "mark" is not given a task index, or task index given is not a number (see log.txt and log2.txt)
2. Similar issue as (1) for command "unmark" (see log3.txt)

Other than the mentioned issues, everything else seems to work fine. Good job!

From my opinion, as we may have more than one exceptions, can be checked or unchecked, we can handle all exceptions by using throw at one place for more organized code. It also works if you print the error message directly.

**1. :fas-info-circle: PE Bug Validity Inquiry**
</div>

Hello,

The issue at question is: #566

I would like some clarification regarding whether or not this specific bug classifies as a bug, since the input is a Disk Operating System command for the end of input, our program will throw an exception. I believe most, if not all, programs will inherit similar behaviour. 

Some clarification on whether or not this type of exception should have been handled by the developers would be appreciated. Thank you.

**1. :fas-info-circle: A-Exceptions tag on iP progress dashboard but not in Week 5 tasks**
</div>

Hello! I noticed that I have an uncompleted A-Exceptions tag on the iP progress dashboard. However, the iP tasks for Week 5 only include:
1. Learn from others (optional)
2. Add Increment as a branch: Level-5
3. Add Increment: A-Packages

Should we tag the same Level-5 commit as A-Exceptions? Or was this a mistake on the dashboard?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Accidentally submitted too early**
</div>

I think my touchpad was not working properly or something but I couldn't click on to move on from the first question to the other questions and I accidentally submitted the entire thing while I was trying to get to the other exercises. Now it shows me that I've only done 1 out of 4 questions. Is there a way to reverse this? Or hand in the exercises some other way?
