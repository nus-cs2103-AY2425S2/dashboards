Can save for next iteration if you want and can merge:

The idea why I changed this is because the commit happened before the predicate changed which unintended behaviour since a command is supposed to commit after all the changes happened
this also caused a bug in the test case

So I made it so the commit happens after the predicate changed
which is the intended behaviour

I think the way to knock out all the bugs at once is to have a system that safe way that decides whether a save state of the address book is committed or not

Is the issue stated in your comment an additional issue 
if it is might want to make it a separate issue

also might want to have more details about wdym by edit does not allow for multiple tags?

If I am understanding what you mean correctly
I think multiple tags can be added
as shown here I edited the tag "anime" and "brick" onto the 2nd indexed person
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/600cf8ad-13ac-4fb4-a64c-af563eb4e671)
This is my command history:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9f70ad9-e6f7-4b46-9787-dbbb90f0fd74)

Can add multiple tags by doing 
`edit INDEX t/tag1 t/tag2`
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c89cd6c-9774-4a66-9684-701ec82aeaa5)

The problem might be that the tags might get old tags get replaced instead of added??
might want to make that a separate issue

oh so that means the issue I experienced was actually this one not Pranav's one
they are two separate issues
the one Pranav experienced is sorting after pinning
mine is this one sorting after pinning
I also experienced the same thing where pin/pins dont really get shown for some reason

Perhaps should double check that REGEX is correct? specifically, the `.` in `github.com` will match antyhing. should use
```
- private static final String GITHUB_URL_REGEX = "&hat;https://github.com/"; 
+ private static final String GITHUB_URL_REGEX = "&hat;https://github\\.com/"; 
```
And username regex needs to be anchored (so that no trailing text)
```
- public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = GITHUB_URL_REGEX + USERNAME_REGEX;
+ public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = GITHUB_URL_REGEX + USERNAME_REGEX + "$";

I would recommend using a REGEX here, to test for a format of 0-100, with optional % sign.
for example
```
&hat;(100|[1-9]?\d)(%)?$
```
Then in the constructor, drop the % sign. such as
```
if (input.endsWith("%")) ``{``
            return input.substring(0, input.length() - 1);
        ``}``
        return input;
``}``
```
Also, please make sure that using int as the input parameter is OK... because of how the input works, it might break everything. I would recommend changing progressValue to string in the constructor then convert to int only when assigning..

Maybe this type conversion shouldn't be handled here. Because this is (likely) what would happen when the user inputs, it is a string and it is not parsed. Refer to previous comments. 
I'm not sure if manual testing was done, using the app itself, and whether it accepts the user input for progress or not. I would recommend doing so if not.

Should add placeholder methods in `Person.java` instead of here. 
Also code can be cleaned up. example:
```
private Predicate<Person> getFilter(Model model) throws CommandException ``{``
        return switch (filterType) ``{``
            case "course", "team" -&gt; ``{``
                boolean exists = model.getFilteredPersonList().stream().anyMatch(p -&gt; p.getCourse().value.equalsIgnoreCase(filterValue));
                if (!exists) ``{``
                    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_FILTER_VALUE);
                ``}``
                yield p -&gt; p.getCourse().value.equalsIgnoreCase(filterValue);
            ``}``
            case "progress" -&gt; ``{``
                int progress;
                try ``{``
                    progress = Integer.parseInt(filterValue);
                ``}`` catch (NumberFormatException e) ``{``
                    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_FILTER_VALUE);
                ``}``
                yield p -&gt; p.getProgress().value <= progress;
            ``}``
            default -&gt; throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_FILTER);
        ``}``;
    ``}``
```
yield assigns value to the return value directly at the top. Done due to duplicate code.

This looks great! But I maybe suggest that we can use the original DeleteCommandParse, but first check if it matches regex of student id. If it does, proceed with student id. otherwise proceed like before. This way we only need to add 1 check isntead of 2 (because syntax error is handled by index regardless)

Good point, I think generally speaking || implies && here since you can't have two non-nulls, it's just the issue of if student A has index 1 and ID of A1, if delete with 1 should be equal to delete with A1. But can leave for future if got time.

I wonder if this part's sequence is correct? Because right now this shows that deletecommand is communicating with the model before getting a confirmation, which doesn't seem like it follows the correct flow. Maybe can separate the first execute call and the second execute call?

This looks good! However the inputting seems a bit counterintuitive, especially since the repo doesn't have to be under their own username, for example the current tp repo is
https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp
maybe just use the URL still? 
Also, maybe consider implementing bulk assignments to project teams (easily doable with streams)? Can refer to `AssignCommand` to see how it can be done

        ``}``

        List&lt;String[]> personRows = new ArrayList&lt;>();
        List&lt;String[]> timedEventRows = new ArrayList&lt;>();

        boolean isTimedEventSection = false;

        for (String[] row : rows) ``{``
            if (row.length > 0 && row[0].equalsIgnoreCase("timedEvents")) ``{``

            ``}`` else ``{``

        ``}``

        String[] personHeaders = Person.getAttributes().toArray(new String[0]);
        List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object>> personsData = retrieveData(personHeaders, personRows);

        String[] timedEventHeaders = TimedEvent.getAttributes().toArray(new String[0]);
        List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object>> timedEventsData = retrieveData(timedEventHeaders, timedEventRows);

Purpose of assertions is to make sure the program doesn't behave incorrectly. Testing is to make sure it behaves correctly. So testing for assertions themselves aren't needed. Assertions also do not change the functionality of code and is straight forward and very unlikely to give rise to bugs. Hence can safely ignore the test coverage

i think it should not implement getAddressBook() in this modelStub. It is not needed in the tests. Also, returning a new AddressBook is troublesome (because we have the person list and cca list.)

I think this logic can be more encapsulated in method `ParserUtil.parseCcaInformation()`. But for now it's fine.

Seems like the `parseCcaInformation` and `parseCcaInformations` need logic revision. For example, return type Set&lt;CcaInformation> of `parseCcaInformation` seems not accurate. 

For example, parseCcaInformation creates a new CCA instead of referring to one in CcaList. This causes the CcaTotalAttendance not consistent to the actual CCA object in the list.

Considering that this method was set during MVP, unstable iteration, we need to revise this in the later iteration.

I also think it is good to have implement add Cca and delete Cca Commands to mitigate this issue. Since parser object should not have the dependency to the Model (i.e. CcaList), and considering the EditStudentDescriptor (because there is no way we can get CCA object from CCA list in Model in EditStudentDescriptor), I think this is going to be a lot better architecture design.

Note that I've noticed the task has already been done previously, so I assumed it have been done by @waylonggggg when he was created the website. So I've only changed the github base address in the default page. 
The change refers to the heading "CCAttendance" at the top navigation bar, which was previously (probably) "AB3".

Instead of removing these functions, perhaps the _internal_ implementation of getters can be modified to return values from `JobApplication` (instead of `Person`). This is so that the existing layer of abstraction doesn't get affected, and the getters (of `Person`) that are already in use by other parts of the codebase need not be removed.

If I remember correctly, I think the `ParserUtil#parseName` function removes leading and trailing spaces by default. So technically the user will still be able to enter a space at the beginning (either intentionally or by accident), and the app will still accept it?

nitpick: In addition to this, I think an additional constructor _without_ `hasChangedTheme` (which will set `hasChangedTheme` to false) will be useful so that other commands that do not modify this variable do not have to explicitly state it as `false` (e.g., ExitCommand, HelpCommand, etc.).

I guess in that case it should be okay. And I do agree that this is a very low priority issue. However if you wish to change the implementation to be slightly more scalable, you can refer to [this website](https://www.baeldung.com/java-enum-values) (specifically [this section](https://www.baeldung.com/java-enum-values#locating-values)).

The boolean variable seems to represent if the user _has changed_ the theme (the result of `ThemeCommand`), and it is the getter method that seems to serve the purpose of indicating if the theme _should be changed_.

Additionally, it seems to violate the course's coding standard for naming boolean variables (see [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#naming)) as `changeTheme` doesn't necessarily sound like a boolean (it sounds more like an action).

Can this logic be moved to `Theme` itself? So that, should the list of themes change in the future, parseTheme will not be affected (otherwise the changes get propagated to both codes).

This is a low priority issue, so the code can be left as it is for now.

> just to check, if I close the application with light mode, the application will remember the last mode that I used right? (correct me if I am wrong) so is this the best way to do it?

No. That will be done in #170, I think. @GauhVish can help to confirm.

Current implementation is that the app will start with dark theme by default. When the user switches to light mode, it will stay so while the app is open. When it is closed and reopened, the app will go back to dark mode.

The changes I introduced does not change this behaviour; it only ensures the help window will switch to a light theme once when light mode is selected (currently help window remains in dark mode regardless of the color mode chosen).

Hope that clarified your doubts!

I think I agree with @GauhVish . Viewing instructions can be thought of more like a nice-to-have, rather than a must-have. This is because technically the user can always learn the commands on their own (via trial and error, the error messages we give, etc.) even though the process will be tedious. We can always implement this feature later to improve the user experience. @DanielJames0302 @ho-thanh-und you guys are welcome to share your opinions on this as well.

> I'm assuming from jobs this will specifically be job titles/positions, correct? From the description of [@Zonnie-23](https://github.com/Zonnie-23), this would be: "In this increment, to identify an applicant's possible role in the company, there would be 9 main job position to choose from

Basically, we treat the value of job titles as strings and perform a keyword search on the job titles (on top of performing the same search on names as well). Hopefully this makes sense.

Hi @Zonnie-23! I am aware of this, but thanks for pointing it out anyways! The original code made use of `assertFalse` instead of `assertNotTrue` (following the tutorial for adding commands to AB3). However, Intellij suggested to change it to `assertNotTrue`, and I just followed it. This could be changed if the rest of @AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/developers agree.

One way is to copy over the existing diagram and remove the parts that is already mentioned in the original, so as to just  showcase the new components added and how they work together. You can take inspiration from `docs/diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml`, where the various `*Command` classes were "combined" together into one "generic" `XYZCommand` class. And then you can have a separate `.puml` file that goes into the details of the 3 panels and cards (that is if you find this to be really necessary).

Alternatively, as mentioned in my comment, you can rearrange the order of the three boxes to ensure the arrows do not overlap. You can refer to the guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html#repositioning-elements) from the course website for more details.

I think the path for schedule board can be moved to the right to align with the schedule board panel. Additionally, the color of the path (i.e., the blue background color) looks jarring when compared to the rest of the UI.

1. Currently there is no feature to import the data (other than to rename it to the default file locations, like you mentioned). But I agree that this will have to be documented (I am still working on the documentation for `save`)

I believe #156 is not an issue, given that flags starting with `/` were introduced (for `save` command in particular) in #108. As such, this could be removed from the description of this PR. You can also consider closing the issue (since there wasn't really a bug to begin with?).

I think there could be a method in `ParserUtil` to handle the parsing of attributes for user inputs, like how all the other parsers currently do for their flags that need to check for validity. Perhaps one method for individual and one for list like Tag. Allows error handling there too so there isn't a large try block.

The constraints message and method for actual checking for attributes can then be attached to the `Attribute` Enum, like how it is for Email and Phones etc.

Since this performs IO operations, is it more suitable to be in Storage which has the responsibility of "Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk", as a new interface separate from `AddressbookStorage`  and `UserPrefStorage`?

the parse method would perform the validity check by calling an appropriate method from `Attribute`, which in turn throws error when something is wrong. Its one continuous step. That's how the other things like email are parsed i think, can look at the other `ParserUtils`

Would it be clearer to change the Success message to report the number of people added, so that users know the effect  of running the command like how `find` does it?

Yes, message may not be clear. I think the same effect can be achieved by reporting number of people added (see comment above)? Then we can remove this code as if no one matches, the command would report 0 people added.

Following the demo provided in this week's content I am unsure if it resumes at step 2. Also, see earlier comments.

Here is the snippet of the demo I am referring to
```
MSS:
  1. User chooses to transfer money.
  2. OBS requests for details of the transfer.
  3. User enters the requested details.
  4. OBS requests for confirmation.
  5. User confirms.
  6. OBS transfers the money and displays the new account balance.
  Use case ends.
Extensions:
  3a. OBS detects an error in the entered data.
      3a1. OBS requests for the correct data.
      3a2. User enters new data.
      Steps 3a1-3a2 are repeated until the data entered are correct.
      Use case resumes from step 4.
```

I am unsure if this is where the use case starts from. Following the example (see comment below), of the OBS in this week's content, I was thinking if it would be better for it to start immedaitely from "User requests to add a student".

I also think that omitting "into the list" would be more appropriate as it seems to be too detailed.

Would it be better to say "TAssist displays all students" instead?

Nitpick: mandatory suggests minimal, thus for emphasis maybe it would be better to rephrase it along the lines of "User provides only the mandatory details..."
Nitpick: also missing another extension where user provides mandatory and some but not all fields. Might be better to merge both extensions.

I am actually unsure if MSS should be the minimal fields or all fields. 

In addition, I am also unsure if it is too detailed if we were to include all fields instead of abstract it out in the use case (ie. simply labelling them as mandatory fields and all fields like what you have done.)

If there are any uncertainties, maybe we can post on the forum to check in with the others as well?

Missing precondition that TAssist does not have all entries filled out (eg. if we are using `int` then `INT_MAX`.).

Might be good to reference our document on the week 6 submission as everything should be stated there for both preconditions as well as extensions.

I understand that because we are catering the use cases to the user and the system, persist and loading of data is not included. 

However I was thinking if it would be better to do so as separate use cases because they should technically be part of all functionalities (eg. updating records, system has to write into file, thus if there are any errors they should be shown as an extension as well). What do you think?

Minimally, considering the fact that AB is meant to have a human editable file format, loading data should be a file format because the user can create their own JSON files to be used in TAssist.

Essentially the `fromIndex` is being recursively shortened in the `findPrefixPosistions` method earlier.
So this final else block is to check that the very prefix if applicable is terminating.

If that is not included, because `endsWith` does not take in parameter `fromIndex`, it will recursively flag the last `prefix` as valid, and will result in a recursion loop,

The code is well-structured, and the logic is clear. üëçThank you for creating AssignCommand. I just think you could extract out the repetitive parts, like the addTimeEvent and the try-catch block in the `execute` method, to make the code cleaner and avoid having too long method.

I'm not sure should be `or` or `and` here. Maybe you could use `Objects.equals` so that it returns true even if both values are null, and use && to check the remaining fields. 
```
return Objects.equals(timedEventIndex, otherAssignCommand.timedEventIndex)
                && Objects.equals(studentIndex, otherAssignCommand.studentIndex)
                && Objects.equals(studentId, otherAssignCommand.studentId))
                && Objects.equals(classNumber, otherAssignCommand.classNumber)));
```
Does this show what you want?

These should be capitalized since they are inputs provided by the user‚Äîthey're not filter_value literals. You can decide which format is clearer. For example, maybe something like this would help:
```
* For progress filter type: an integer between 0 and 100.
* For team filter type: must match an existing team name. 
* for class filter type:: (Not yet implemented) must match an existing course value.
```
or can make them to full sentences, if that is clearer. 
OR capitalized all the PARAMs are already enough

I think using else if would make the code cleaner, it helps prevent cases where both the index and student ID are either not null or both null. Although it's unlikely to happen, I think it's safer to keep the logic on a single path, just in case, like if the CSV file is stored incorrectly or due to some other unexpected issue in the future.

Checked coding standard [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html).

This should be ok: you either have @params for all or none. 
In particular, the coding standard doesn't seem to advocate what was given originally (i.e. params as in-text to the description). Not very certain why is was used.

@return can be omitted if the method does not return anything or the return value is obvious from the rest of the comment.
@params can be omitted if all parameters of a method have self-explanatory names, or they are already explained in the main part of the comment i.e., if none of the @params add any value. This means the comment will have @param for all its parameters, or none.

Sorry, what is the "argsString.length() != fromIndex" for? 
If you want to avoid detecting prefixes before the fromIndex, shouldn't it be something like
"argsString.length() - fromIndex > prefix.length() - 2"?
e.g.
argsString = "xx -mc"
argsString.length() = 5, flag -mc is at index 3 to 5
Only detect the prefix if fromIndex = 3 or below, so
5 - (&lt;=3) >= 2 or > 1

Can use your colours. But I temporarily reverted to the text "MC", "ATT", "NO", and I think I renamed the UNICODEs to ATTENDED_TAG, NOT_ATTENDED_TAG, and ON_MC_TAG. 
Reason: There is a significant discrepancy between how emojicons are displayed on MacOS and Windows. On windows, the emojicon follows the colour of the text (which is white). On MacOS, it seems to follow the original emoji colour. Probably a feature flaw or discrepancy that I want to avoid.

to be honest idk how to use the message constraints here. Because the Attendance object is created internally (not by user input), and it's just checking whether the given attendance (0,1,2) and week (1-13) are valid. So it's not even intended for the user lol. The user should see a separate message from InvalidCommandException.

**88 :octicon-git-pull-request::octicon-comment:** %%(commented on own PR)%%
</div>

Hmm, I get what you mean. I'm just thinking that it's better to restrict the attendance string to be either empty, or of length 13. Because if we accept a string shorter than 13, we are making the assumption that the digits start from week 1. (length 5 --> weeks 1-5). Similarly, we could then use the same idea to accept a string longer than 13, and add code to truncate anything beyond the 13th character. So from the perspective of isValidAttendanceString, I think it makes sense to only view strings of length 13 as valid. (Also note that this method is technically used "internally", meaning that the user doesn't actually pass in an attendance string in add, edit or att. It's more of a safeguard to ensure the devs don't misuse the AttendanceList.generateAttendanceList method by passing in strings that don't make sense. Hence I feel it's ok to be a bit stricter for internal use, as it doesn't translate to "more convenience" for the user lol.)

Hmm. I think I am sharing Hannah's parseMultipleIndexes method, for multiple indexes -i 1,2,3
The difference is that I am parsing multiple tutorial groups here too, because remember the mark attendance command also supports marking for the whole tutorial group. for multiple tutgroups -t T01,T02,T03

Because it's called "parseMultipleIndexes", I think it makes sense to have another method to parse tutorial groups rather than indexes. The implementations call other methods to handle tutGroups too

It's a way to circumvent type erasure. 
I tried alternatives like varargs, but it would require packing and unpacking.

This is partially my fault too, so I have identified where the error can be resolved:
line 119 in Messages.java
.append("Attendance List") ~.append(...)~
to:
.append("Attendance List") 
.append(person.getAttendanceList().value.isEmpty() ? "-" : person.getAttendanceList())

Or you can remove it anyway from display of the attributes. On the GUI, you aren't going to deal with the attendance string of 13 digits, which might not make sense to them anyway.

With least changes it'd be to move the method into `ParserUtil`; you can check

It's not one continuous step; e.g. they'll take a "email", check with regex if it's a "email", and then wrap it as a Email; here we take a "attribute", check and parse with reflection, as a Attribute enum. The flow is different. There's quite some work to do to force an enum to have class-like behavior too

JavaFX has poor hyperlink support, involving lots of UI change. @all to decide:

## Components

### Comments

## Introduction

### 1. Identification of target users and assumptions about users, e.g. prior knowledge

**Zechary**
- Clear identification of target users using **bold font** network marketeers.
- Could explain more what is meant by "often deal with numerous leads, customers and partners".
- Required prior knowledge is mentioned ("downloading files and opening folders"), and guidance for advanced actions are promised where necessary.

### 2. Logical table of contents

### 3. User-centric description of the product

### 4. Quick Start appropriate for target users and fit-for-purpose including installation, overview of UI, and CLI tutorial

## Implementation

### 1. Fit-for-purpose instructions appropriate for target users

### 2. Consideration of user needs by providing when appropriate

#### a. Warnings
#### b. Expected output
#### c. Tips to effectively use product
#### d. Customized examples

**Alex**

#### Strengths:
- Instructions clear and structured, suitable for target users
- Some warnings provided
- Includes useful tips for command usage
- Provides examples for command syntax

#### Areas for improvement:
- More warnings needed for irreversible commands
- No command output examples - users may struggle to verify correct execution
- Tips are scattered throughout the document, could be better formatted
- Can customise examples better to improve relatability

## Presentation

### 1. Consistent use of formatting elements, e.g. font style and size, colours*, screenshot size and cropping, and bulleted or numbered lists.

### 2. Layout facilitates skimming and scanning, e.g. sections, headers, and white space

### 3. Navigation facilitated by providing internal/external hyperlinks

*The documentation tool allows limited colours e.g. green, red, yellow*

**Wenrui**
- Generally consistent formatting style - bold headers, numbered lists
- Some command descriptions are in paragraph form, some bullet points - can make it more consistent
- Well-structured layout with clear sections and whitespace
- Could include more screenshots to help users visualise commands and their effects
- Internal and external hyperlinks added, but placement within text can be more intuitive - closer to relevant command

## Language

### 1. Language increases readability, e.g. concise, unambiguous
### 2. Language is user-oriented
### 3. Language is appropriately contextualized for target users, product, and genre
### 4. Language choices are consistent throughout

**Nandita**

#### Readability
- Language is clear and structured, easy to follow
- Some technical terms used without explanations (e.g., JSON file, command terminal)
- Sentences are generally concise, but some explanations are a bit long-winded

#### User-oriented language
- User-friendly guide with step-by-step instructions
- Some instructions assume technical knowledge (`java -version`, `diskutil list`) - can briefly explain

#### Contextualisation
- Guide assumes that users are comfortable with CLI, which matches their TA of network marketeers
- Explanations are tailored well for users who prefer typing over GUI interactions
- Lack of troubleshooting steps in case a command doesn‚Äôt work - can include error handling tips

#### Consistency
- Commands are formatted consistently
- Some minor inconsistencies would be the use of "persons" and "people", and changing "AddressBook" to "AscendNetwork".

For JsonAdaptedListing, perhaps you need an association line between Listing and Person(1 to *), with navigability from Listing to Person. 

In the code, Owners is stored as a set of String but these String will be used to retrieve the associated Person model so there should be an association there.

You could put a note in the diagram explaining this detail.

isAvailable is a primitive boolean so in Java, so it cannot have a null value and will default to false. If someone were to directly edit the json data file and change the true/false value to let say "yes", the data will not load (and would need input validation on storage end to be dealt with). Hence, I think keeping it as it is will be fine.

don't say click on contact, because that is a UI detail, furthermore, we are using command line, maybe write "user requests to view contact info" ? or replace step 2 with "AddressBook shows all matching results and their contact details" ?

@isaacchua0309 Take note that this was the method that was added by @gohlucas that caused the clashed with your withSports() method in PersonBuilder.java and caused us to have to rename your method. I think we may need to study your withSports() method (now named withSportsTest() ) to see what went wrong and see where your method is being used subsequently.

Can maybe change the ordering of the message to

T and R capitalized
Leave class number blank to unassign a class"

I think if possible, should change all the changes of 'address' to 'location' in the docs back to 'address'

Reason being that the path is still 'java/seedu/address' in the codebase, and not 'java/seedu/location'
Probably the fault of IntelliJ not being able to detect that the Address class and java/seedu/address refers to a different term

Perhaps since this chunk of code is repeated a few times, it would be good to abstract them out as another function. One suggestion I have is to use 3 fields: `existingSchedule`, `newSchedule`, `int type`

Was thinking can use `type` in deciding how the description gets created since the first part of the description is different in each of the 4 cases, but same at the end. Could possibly use an assert to make sure its from 0 to 3 too.

Just wanna confirm that the reason why `model.getFilteredPersonList()` wasn't used here is because it can cause some bug where the person being edited is checked? Because I think that if it was checked against the people in the `lastShownList`, the program can miss out other people.

E.g. User used `find Bella` and the lastShownList now only has Bella. If they edit Bella and change the RS/OTS, would it be checked against other persons?

Hmm but I was thinking that this is for testing purposes. As a personal trainer, they most likely wouldn't be familiar with using command prompt to launch applications.

Unless we teach them how to `cd` into the correct directory as well, because it won't be intuitive for them to know how to do that.

Ohh understand. What about something like this:
'''suggestion
4. Go to your home folder and double-click on the `.jar` file to launch the application.&lt;/br>
    * If the above does not work, try the below steps:
        1. Open a command terminal for your OS e.g. Powershell in Windows, zsh in macOS, bash in Linux
        2. Change the directory you are currently in to the home folder, using the command `cd`.
            * A simple way to find the directory is to go to the home folder your normal file browsing app and copying the directory at the address bar. For example, the command could be `cd /Downloads/FitFlowFolder`
        3. Use the `java -jar &lt;FitFlow file name>.jar` command to run the application.&lt;br>
'''

Alternatively we can have a shell script that launches the application for macOS, something like
'''
#!/usr/bin/env zsh 

java -jar &lt;FitFlow file name>.jar

`Set::add` actually handles duplicates ([reference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html#add-E-)). Additionally, it would return a `boolean` to indicate if the item was added or not.

1. Can consider modifying `Tag::toString` (i.e. `[Tag]` -&gt; `"Tag"`) instead of replacing
2. Maybe we should create a new class `Tags` to represent a `Set&lt;Tag>`?
    * For consistency: consider `Messages::format` which prints `[colleagues][friends]`
    * Might also remove the need for `generateTags` and `formatTags` in the tests

Point 1 affects point 2 (on consistency) so I prefer they be done together. However, I acknowledge point 2 to be medium-high effort as we would need to refactor all instance of `Set&lt;Tag>` in the codebase. So I am ok to merge current implementation, but to update in later iterations.

I just took a look at `RemoveTagCommand` in #106, and saw it has repeated codes with `AddTagsCommand` (i.e. `createUpdatedPerson`).

When I reviewed the `AddTagsCommand` previously, I hadn't considered possible implications with the parser (sorry). Following up from the above comment, I am wondering if we could make use of `EditCommand.EditPersonDescriptor` for these new commands.

What I am thinking of is to:

1. Extract `EditPersonDescriptor` into another file (e.g. `CommandUtils`)
2. Shift `EditCommand::createEditPerson` into `EditPersonDescriptor`
3. `[Edit|AddTags|RemoveTag]Command` and its respective parsers to use this

Pros:

- Single point of modification
    * Consider adding a new field for `Person` (e.g. `comments`)
    * We would need to update (at least) 3 constructor methods
- Reduce inconsistency for the app
- Ease of understanding since all uses the same system/logic

Cons:

- May require more time (and effort) to coordinate changes and implement now
- Requires refactoring of existing implementations (i.e. low-medium effort)

@twhjames @kylieluk88 As of now, no action is required. In the current iteration, I think we may not have enough time anyways. However, we can consider this when improving/refactoring in future iterations.

This might cause confusion in the `edit` (and maybe `add`) command. In `edit`, it is ok to have a blank/empty comment i.e. when trying to clear it.

Even though it is unlikely for the user to see this error message (for `edit`) since they will probably not write beyond 500 characters, I think we should still handle it.

Maybe we can append `, and it should not be blank` to the message in `FindCommandParser` instead of changing the constant here?

The concern for extra whitespaces in the value (e.g. `"n/   Alice   Bob"`), it will be handled by line 42 when we split (i.e. returns `["Alice", "Bob"]`).

I agree that there are no explicit usage, I guess it is a _good-to-have_ according to this:

> Objects.hashCode() is a null-safe method we can use to get the hashcode of an object. Hashcodes are necessary for hash tables and the proper implementation of equals(). - [source](https://www.baeldung.com/java-objects-hash-vs-objects-hashcode#2-objectshashcode)

In the first place, I added this method because the other field classes has it, and seemed like `Person::hashCode` relies on it.

@AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-3/developers I decided to keep it simple in favour of KISS ([link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#practice-kissing)). For new commands in the future, please update the `HelpCommand` accordingly. Thanks.

It seems like this behaviour is intentional (and expected). I tried similar commands in my OS terminal and they also behave the same.

A fix for this might impact UX with no tangible benefit. I suggest to close this issue with no fix.

Another point to consider from the module website ([ref](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/tp-pe.html#guidelines-for-bug-triaging)):

This is found under "Functionality bugs" [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/tp-pe.html#functionality-bugs-2). Since we still have the same level of support as AB-3, I am ok to close this issue with no fix.

Obligatory good use of streams!

Minor nitpicks for fix/future consideration
- [ ] Suggest the first "\n" to be made explicit at the concatentation, rather than inside personsFormatted (something about layer of abstraction)
- [ ] Consider if the act of getting personsFormatted is a job for messages or should it be part of Todo --> todo.getPersonsFormatted()?
- [ ] Consider if full information of all contacts is the desired default when listing information of a Todo?

I see what you mean now. I initially thought of it as user should know everything before entering the command, but the better perspective is perhaps to consider in broad terms, how the user would gain access to the necessary information, whilst performing some task. Since this task is presumably non-trivial, memory wise (e.g. the ID you mentioned)

Will make suitable adjustments

I changed my mind over this. I think for the relatively minor benefits of auto renumbering during updates, we still have added cost to _look_ at a markdown rendering. Furthermore, the extensions have no such renumbering, and it seems most of us did it the other way too. So I'll change to match all of yours.

1. Extract all "top level" commands (contact, ..., help, bye, ...) into CliSyntax class. All subcommands are implemented in respective XCliSyntax class.
2. Shift all Parsing into HelpCommandParser class.
3. Help Command no longer opens the pop up window
4. HelpCommandParser class is to be updated with every feature update, following the convention that the feature shall have a COMMAND_WORD and MESSAGE_USAGE which is imported here.
5. @raw-asparagus Help me check that it works for person = contact

A couple of key concepts
1. Fragment storage into 3 folders -&gt; storage.person, storage.todo, storage.event.
2. Each folder has
- An interface which defines to save, read, and to where (XStorage)
- Actual implementation (JsonXStorage) of the operations, which uses...
- A json representation of the object (JsonX)
- A json representation of the collection of object (JsonXManager)
3. Updates to sampleutil class to include sample event and todo lists
4. Updates to execution of application to load sample or present databases, and to save them to the specified default paths.

Resolution behavior with representative example:
Suppose contact 1 has tag `a` already

* `contact tag 1 --tag a a a` -&gt; duplicate tags found
* `contact tag 1 --tag a` -&gt; tag already exists
* `contact edit 1 --tag a a` -&gt; duplicate tags found
* `contact edit 1 --tag a` -&gt; ok, because replacement
* `contact tag 1 --tag a a` -&gt; duplicate tags found
* `contact tag 1 --tag a` -&gt; tag already exists
* `contact untag 1 --tag a a` -&gt; duplicate tags found

Have fixed all three.
- check for duplicate tags in add, edit, tag, untag, filter
- all filter ops support 6 cols:
   - contact: name, id, email, tag, course, group
   - todo: name, deadline, location, status, links, tags
   - event: name, start, end, location, links, tags
- adds tests for commands but not parsers.
- fixes the ordering for event and todo tests

Generally LGTM, let's also support limiting errors only to the scope of item (i.e. if any component of contact/todo/event is corrupted in the json file, delete only that item)

Good effort! You can import the PREFIX_NAME etc from the CliSyntax, just like how it is done in the AddCommandParser, then you don't have to keep repeating the CliSyntax. If I understook this part of the code correctly, you are checking if each prefix in the ```ArgumentMultimap``` are present and valid. Maybe you can refer to how ```AddCommandParser``` is using the ```ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize```. Basically, it is already done for you.

I think we can make the use cases more thorough. Right now we are using ID to identify the contacts, but no one ever remembers the IDs of their students, so they will need to first search for the ID using the contact names if they want to add someone to the to-do.

1. Should change "student" to "contact."

- Remove unnecessary UI details such as input commands and error messages.
- Ensure all UCs contain interactions between user and system.
- The UCs should resume from the last appropriate step instead of ending in case of invalid user input.
- Reformat UC inclusions with &lt;u> tags and UC numbers

Adhere to the following syntactic rules:
- "User requests to do XXX"
- "TC shows/deletes/cries XXX"
- "Use case #X: Delete a person"
- "TC displays an error message."

This is intended. The command usage message specifies that the index must be a positive integer. Maybe we can improve the error message for `todo delete 12` by replacing "invalid" with "out of range."

> * `event add n/Tutorial 2 s/23-02-29 10:10 e/23-03-01 13:13 l/NUS S16` returns   the default MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS. Since `DatetimeUtil.java` throws  `IllegalArgumentException("Invalid datetime: " + string)`, was the intended behaviour to display the invalid input to the user?

Interesting point. The message for invalid datetime is mostly for debugging, not for displaying.

I believe every other field except for index will display the `MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS` if the input is invalid. I think this is acceptable, as the message can point the user to the problematic inputs. For indices, since there can be multiple indices in a command, we can point the user to the invalid index, like in this PR's implementation.

Fixed issues:

- [X] persons listed" should be "todos/events" listed
- [X] todo filter d/ (x, -) is open interval, i.e. datetime = x is excluded.
- [ ] todo filter n/ uses exact match rather than partial match.
- [X] Does not match single string of multiple words "NUS UTown", with or without quote, etc.
   - This is due to a bug in `TodoLocationPredicate` and `EventLocationPredicate`. I accidentally used `getName` instead of `getLocation`.
- [X] help todo filter not recognized
- [ ] todo filter s/ could support more possible values
- [X] todo unlink operation resets the filter view from filtered to full.

I did not notice that the contact filter command uses partial match. Personally, I think partial match is more trouble than it's worth, but if there is enough justification, then it can be an issue for v1.5.

>Name, Group, Course: Alphanumeric + space

Is there any reason for the difference? If not, then we can standardize both to Alphanumeric + space.

> Location will be good to support with more detail -- maybe things like -, # will be helpful, hence we may have any character for it

Should we allow special characters for name, course, and group? And which special characters should we support to avoid clashing with our commands.

Yeah I noticed. But isFound is kinda like a yes/no answer, just like areBothFileUnique. Strictly speaking bothFilesAreUnique is more of a true/false. After reading the documentations, I have always assume that boolean sounding variable has to begin a simple verb like can, has, is. On that note: is `foundFile` a valid boolean sounding variable?

Also, I was thinking of possibly not needing this abstraction and allow multiple roles if the archive command is implemented.

> Thanks for adding the number 3 task for this week Enzo! Is it okay if we divide this into 3 separate tasks and assign us with the tasks later on?

Sure. There are actually more tasks including use cases, non-functional requirements and glossary. I guess I can split the user profile and value proposition out for someone else to do. üòÑ

@GauhVish I think viewing usage instructions is important, especially for new users, as they might not know how to use the product. While you could argue that there is already a user guide, but there should be at least some basic usage guide in built in the app. I don't mind changing it to 2 stars, but I feel this is up for discussion with the rest.

> * Should we add the user story for exiting the application under must-have?

@HarishB99 I am thinking that it is not necessary because when we convert to use cases, the exiting of the application is just represented as 'Use Case ends'

However, a possible use case to add is to autosave the contact details onto the drive after any modifications are made to the address book.

> Perhaps the person information result of view command should be left-aligned ? I guess it would make the information easier to see

I don't mind changing it to be left aligned, just need to check if the rest agrees. The UI changes I made is quite minimal, mainly what I did was to ensure functionality of the code. 

I was thinking more about whether the Person should be passed through CommandResult or passed through model manager, since the current implementation of model manager is immutable, and by adding the person into the model class, I inadvertently made the modelmanager and logicmanager class mutable (because the person may change every time the view command is used.

Functionality wise, quite thorough in terms of dealing with all aspects of scheduling. 
Food for thought: Should schedule really be a parallel data book? I believe you are using the name and email as the primary key to uniquely identify each person. 
Great job. But with this much changes, more test cases needs to be added to ensure that there are no serious bugs, especially ensure that the two are synchronised and anything such as email or name is changed, these changes are reflected in the parallel schedule book.

I think this  member check is a bit redundant, since it's a hashset we can just add the default role in the first place. If the user inputted the member role again, since it's a hashset nothing happens

A more flexible approach should be to let end-user optionally specify initial `applicationStatus`. If `advance(int)` exists in `Application` to advance by arbitrary rounds, it logically follows that starting point is similarly generalised. This justifies the initialisation of a `DEFAULT_ADDAPPLICATIONSTATUS` static field in `ApplicationStatus` class per my original PR.

As an end-user (albeit opinions may differ), I feel and advocate for multiple dispatch, i.e. allow parsing by (Phone, JobTitle) alongside (PersonIndex, JobIndex) for all 3 application command classes (add, advance, delete) because some will feel that typing in concrete identifiers in the form of phone number and job title is more intuitive.

Hmm, truncating after 12 chars may be quite over-restrictive for real-world job titles which likely can extend beyond this superimposed limit? Perhaps can consider accommodating more characters, or requiring end-users to enter an abbreviation for job titles detected to be too-long by team's definition?

This is a minor refactoring which better signifies `toAdd` is of `Job` type. Its impact is contained only in this class since it is simply a variable name change. If anyone has differing opinions, I have no problem with it being changed back, though I feel that this is better Java code form.

Interesting question. Warren and I discussed this previously. The decision is made on 2 reasons:
1. `model::hasApplication` traces to `Application::equals`, which is a strict equality check involving `ApplicationStatus` too. This may not be desirable as the guard condition serves to filter for preexisting applications of matching person and job regardless of the unknown application status within.
2. It is foreseeable that at the `UniqueApplicationList::contains` level, the method invocation switches from `Application::equals` to `Application::isSameApplication`. While this has the value-add of being more natural, the current implementation of `getApplicationsByPersonAndJob` has an alternative value-add of being more performant (it is adaptive vs stream filters and can execute in a smaller big-O time complexity of O(|smallList|) vs O(|bigList|*|smallList|) linearly).

Referring to Copilot's review, the check for `applicationToAdd` has been refactored to account for `NullPointerException`. Additionally, the check here serves as defensive programming and a form of consistency for `Object::equals` overrides to be strictest possible. Besides, the `applicationToAdd` is in-fact included as a parameter (elevated status from a local variable) so that its `toString` implemented by Warren can be used in static `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` as a better UI rendering to end-user.

fix: resolve checkstyle warnings, logging issue, and refactor code

This commit resolves some cosmetic checkstyle warnings to improve code consistency, such as using `this.` for instance variables. It also fixes a critical issue in `LogsCenter.getLogger()` where inconsistent initialization could lead to `NullPointerException` in both CLI and GUI modes. The logger initialization has been standardized across several classes, including `Main`, `MainApp`, and `AppParameters`.

- `ApplicationStatus::isApplicationStatus` can incorporate guard clause in `Application::advance` in better adherence to SLAP
- `UniqueApplicationList` and `UniqueJobList` must critically guarantee wrapper behaviour of both `internalUnmodifiableList` work as intended, i.e. these views update automatically if underlying `internalList` is modified via CRUD. More JUnit tests need be added to test this, or the contributor can confirm this behaviour, as the premise of using `FXCollections` rest upon this check (else `Collections` differ not and suffice).
- More fields besides `applicationStatus` needed in `Application` class functioning as a "relationship table" between `Person` and `Job`. Team consensus needed for whether to incorporate additional TalentMatch-relevant fields like `evaluation` comment String, `interviewerList` list, `interviewPass` boolean, etc inside `ApplicationStatus` or exist as separate Java classes like default AB3 Person.
- `Application` has `applicationStatus` field of type `ApplicationStatus`, yet `JsonAdaptedApplication` has `applicationStatus` field of type `Integer`. Clarification needed from contributor.

Otherwise LGTM.

Seems like the issue has to do with `hashCode` not being defined for the `Index` class, causing the object's generated hash to be inconsistent with it's equality definition, so `Set&lt;Index>` does not always treat equal Indexes as the same element.

The intended behaviour should be that duplicate indexes are treated as if it were specified once only

I agree with categorising into just essential and special features, as for QOL, speed, etc. they are quite debatable, so it doesn't seem as preferrable.

According to the feature spec, `h/HANDLE` doesn't require that it starts with an `@`. But in the app, the leading `@` is required. I feel that requiring a leading `@` by the user doesn't value add to anything. We can just add it in the UI if we really want the `@`

Thoughts?

This is actually not that trivial to implement. Just like students, attendances have a backward pointer to the tutorial, so you would have to also edit the field in the attendances. Subsequently with submissions, it'll be quite chaotic.

Sure, maybe don't have a blank line in the middle, and combine the commands into a single line (separated by commas)?

```
Usage: tutorial COMMAND
COMMAND: add, delete, list, add-student, delete-student

Looks like model is only being passed in for the purpose of `getApplicationsByPerson` and `getApplicationsByJob`. For now this is ok, but I feel like we should create wrapper methods in  `Logic` instead for these two methods instead. That way can avoid passing in `Model` into the UI side of the app, maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

Necessary to have a application check here at all? I don't see why it would be necessary. A command should only be defined based on its parameters. Extending this, I don't think there is a need to make applicationToAdd a field of the class.

I think the logic here can and should be heavily simplified. Should not use hash sets, as that uses equals and hashcode to do comparisons, but this is not what we want - we want to compare by the weaker notion of isSameJob/isSamePerson. Also, applications by definition are unique, so whats the point of throwing them into a hashSet?

Suggest to just call getApplicationsByPerson, run a for loop, and extract out those applications that satisfy isSameJob as the querying job.

As a temporary fix, we will

- Disallow any changes to the addressbook.json during runtime in the UG
- Discourage any manual changes to the json in the UG
- Alert the user in the UG that any changes to the jsons, if even necessary, need to be replicated across BOTH jsons

Also, we will note in the DG that handling the association class more robustly is a planned enhancement.

Sorry for the miscommunication üò¢. This change is not what I intended. I initially thought you would need to compare countNumerical with persons.asUnmodifiableObservableList().stream().filter(person -&gt; person.getAttribute(attributeName).isPresent()).count(). However, upon further reflection, it seems I was mistaken. I thought the app would display a warning when there was a non-numeric value for the given name, but it seems your intended behavior is different ‚Äî showing the warning when there is a person without the given name or when the corresponding value is non-numeric. I apologize for the confusion üò≠

This behavior feels more natural to me, but I believe it is still part of the design decision. I thought that if you adopted your original idea, you would have done something similar to the lexicographical sorting (i.e., showing the warning when there is a person without the given attribute name). The decision is up to you, and also you can still change it in v1.5 as well üëç

Thank you for coming up with this approach! It seems my intended behavior is slightly different from what you intend. Mine states that the person must have ALL the specified attributes (i.e., if the person does not have any specified attribute name, it has to return false).
We might be able to start from attributes.stream(), but I though it would lead to a more complicated or worse time-complexity code. I might leave it as it is unless anyone can come up with a better alternative.

I suppose the change is not sufficient, because filter -&gt; filter -&gt; undo will clear all the filters, which is different from the expected meaning of `undo`. How about explicitly mentioning that we cannot undo commands that do not introduce changes, e.g., `filter` and `find`?

too complicated to fix in v1.3

issue is nonpositive indices are recognised in `ParserUtil::parseIndex` (and thrown as a `ParseException`) while out-of-range indices are handled in the respective commands (and thrown as a `CommandException`)

having `parseIndex` throw a `CommandException` doesn't work without refactoring at least a few areas since that exception would then need to be handled

I actually fixed it by removing the `trim()`, because for some reason the parser doesn't recognise a prefix if the string provided starts with that prefix (if this turns out to be an issue again I can look into changing the parser behaviour)

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `RecruitTrackPro`, which `Person` references. This allows `RecruitTrackPro` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.&lt;br>

Just checking was there a specific reason for changing the implementation of `separateNewFromExisting()`? 

From my understanding, the original implementation relied on `Set.contains()`, which in turn uses the overridden `Tag.equals()` method. For reference, here‚Äôs the [Set.contains() documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html#contains(java.lang.Object)). Since `Tag.equals()` was implemented to be case-insensitive, `Set.contains()` should correctly identify duplicates regardless of case, making it suitable for commands like `remove-tags`.

The current stream implementation also leverages `Tag.equals()` within `.filter()`, but instead of returning a boolean, it returns a `Tag` object, which is then checked for non-nullity to determine its existence, which achieves the same core logic as the previous implementation?

Could you clarify if there‚Äôs a functional or design reason for this change? Do correct me if i misunderstood, thanks!

From my understanding, a HashSet in Java uses a HashMap internally, and it determines if two objects are ‚Äúequal‚Äù (i.e., duplicates) based on:
  1. `hashCode()`: First, it checks whether the hash codes of the two objects are equal.
  2. `equals()`: If the hash codes match, it then uses the equals() method to check for actual object equality.

So I thought that when I override `equals()` implementation to use `equalsIgnoreCase`, I must also override `hashCode()` accordingly to maintain consistency. [According to the general contract of `hashCode()` and `equals()` is:
If a.equals(b) returns true, then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode() must also return true.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html#hashCode())

So, using `equalsIgnoreCase` in `equals() `means I have to also generate the hash code in a case-insensitive manner, hence I converted it to lower-case.

The process flow with this change will be as such:

2. `ParserUtil.parseTags()`  invokes `new Tags(Collection&lt;String> tagList)`
3.  The overloaded constructor `Tags(Collection&lt;String> tagList)` invokes `ParserUtil.parseTag()` which processes individual Tags

I see where you're coming from, it does not seem right to throw an exception when the test case is implemented to succeed. But it is necessary for me to either throws the exception in the test method signature or catch the exception as the relevant test cases invoked a method that throws one, i.e. the `Tags(Collection&lt;String> tagList)` throws `ParseException`, whereby in this constructor's implementation it invoked `ParserUtil.parseTag()` which throws the `ParseException`. Hence, the unit test which invoked this constructor had to throw (or catches) `ParseException`, even though it will never fail (unless we change the implementation of `Tags(Collection&lt;String> tagList)` or `ParserUtil.parseTag()`

Looking at the other JUnit test cases in `ParserUtilTest` written by the original AB3 developers (though these might not be the best practices), they too throws in the method signature. We can consider refactor all the JUnit test case if we want to standardise this code style in a separate PR?

This stream is iterating through each of the Person's attributes, and checking if it matches any `specifiedAttribute`s, and counting it. Perhaps it would better reflect the intended logical flow if we do an allMatch?

Something like:
```
return person.getAttributes().stream().allMatch(attribute ->
        attributes.stream().anyMatch(specifiedAttribute -&gt; specifiedAttribute.equals(attribute)) ||
        attributes.stream().noneMatch(specifiedAttribute -&gt; specifiedAttribute.matchesName(attribute.getAttributeName()))

A bit clunky that both subclasses do a similar computation for `adjustedAttributeName`, and then call `super.execute(model)` which sorts based on the sub-classes `getComparator()`.

Unless there's some behaviours not implemented yet, maybe the child classes don't need to Override `execute`?

The function name `findClosestName` implies that it will find the closest string by edit distance. In practice, it seems you actually look check that the edit distance must be less than half of the String length.

I think this can be done if each `Person` has some sort of running `Id` that's assigned increasingly. However, this `Id` would need to be saved in the json, and the last used `Id` would also have to be stored.

Hmmm, it seems AB3 implemented it this way in case editing a person causes the entry to be excluded from the filter and no longer in view.

Perhaps we can make it such that editing a person modifies the filter predicate to `existingPredicate.or(person -&gt; person.equals(editedPerson))`? Alternatively we could consider it out of scope, what do you think?

I realised that for our class id, the current validation regex (public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "[&hat;\\s].*") does not limit the length of the input, and does not limit the input to numbers only. The user will be able to type erroneous inputs like 99999999999999999999999 or abcdefg. We should probably fix this before the practical exam.

It seems like your PR is failing a number of test cases and is not building correctly. You can try to run ./gradlew check coverage to find out the specific issues.

Many of the failed test cases show the following:
> **java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError at ClearCommandTest.java:20
> Caused by: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at AppUtil.java:39**

This might be a good starting point for you to look into

Nice that you changed the tags to fit our product. For the next iteration, we can consider if we want to enforce enums to restrict the types of tags that can be assigned. I'm still not sure if a restriction is good, so that is something we will need to discuss. On one hand, it prevents the user from typing erroneous inputs. But on the other, it prevents them from adding more specific tags.

Thanks for adding this back, would be better if the examples can be changed to match the context of our app.
`n/John Doe t/friend` change friend to some mental illness
`t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` line 146 can change also

For the other changes from addressbook to TutorTrack, I don't think its appropriate as its inconsistent with the methods in the same line. Leaving them as addressbook would be fine as it is not the name of the app but the object we are referring to.

Unless we were to rename all instances of addressbook (including the methods and file names) to TutorTrack as well, which wouldn't be appropriate as well.

Might it be better if the check to be included in the list be done in the `PropertyPreference` class itself than the UI? 

For example like a new function to say whether this `PropertyPreference ` object is part of the active search.

This might reduce the amount of arguments passed on to the UI too.

The API could be `setGroup(int index, Group editedGroup)` instead since the caller already knows the index. This saves having to look up the target group again.

That said, since this is the same API that the PersonList uses, I think it's fine to keep it the same.

It's a bit unnecessary to check for duplicates here when UniqueGroupList already does so for us. But I suppose that this mirrors the logic for the EditPersonCommand, so I think it's fine to keep it the same.

Thanks for fixing this. Though, the more I think about it, model.deletePerson() should implicitly call model.deletePersonFromAllGroups(), instead of the having the Command call both functions.

In other words: the Command object should only have to interface with the Model object in one way -- by calling Model.deletePerson(). The Model object should handle everything else from that point on.

What do you think?

If the user supplies no group name (i.e. they omit the g/ parameter), would this cause the group to have an empty name? I think it would, and that is a problem. We should use a null value instead, and possibly even follow what Person does with the EditPersonDescriptor

For these lines, maybe we could take out the "Messages." from the intended command result. We should be importing MESSSAGE_NO_STUDENT_FOUND and MESSAGE_STUDENT_LISTED_OVERVIEW as static imports, and thus, these lines will no longer have the "Messages." in front of them. This will keep our code consistent with the rest of the project.

```
return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_NO_STUDENT_FOUND, predicate))
```

String.format(MESSAGE_STUDENT_LISTED_OVERVIEW, filteredListSize));

The test cases you added are fine, because it helps to verify that the isSamePerson behaves as expected for cases that we expect to be true, but we now no longer have any test cases that cover the cases for when we expect it to return false.

Good question. Since in order to "take the snapshot", we must reserve the previous state which is your previous patient info. Cannot operate directly on the same patient. If so the previous state in the stack is also changed. This is why I encountered the previous bug due to the direct operation on the set of notes and the patient. So have to make a copy of the notes and create a new patient at the current state.

Perhaps the term "domain label" can be reworded to just "domain", or something else more suitable. The term "label" can be misleading since it's not defined.

I agree with points 1 and 2, but not point 3.

From my understanding of your idea of "save", you are intending to do a snapshot of the current json file, by creating a new file, then keeping it in the data folder forever until manually removed. This is not the same as what we specified in the feature specification, or it could be that the feature spec is not sufficiently specific. 

In any case, I think this idea of a snapshot or "archive" is not the same as the "(manual) save" as stated in ([As a cautious user, I want both automatic and manual saving of my contacts list so that I always have a backup and not lose my data.¬†#20](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/issues/20)). We might have a totally separate "snapshot" or "archive" feature that can be implemented in the future.

Ideally the Editing subsection should be under the Save data section. In previous pull requests for addition of snapshot and switchcontact userguide sections, we did not check that it was added in the correct place. A simple fix to re-order the sections will work.

> Perhaps it might be helpful to split this regex into smaller, more manageable parts to pinpoint the exact issue more clearly and address each rule individually. This would allow the user to know exactly what the issue is (e.g. If the user enters an incorrect phone number, Arthive could tell them that the phone number is incorrect, rather than providing a generic error about the input.).

Seems like a good idea, if it will help the user by providing more specific error messages. 
We need to do some testing to ensure that the correct error message shows at the correct occurrence.

I think we can just leave this functionality in the app. Some people may appreciate being able to set a specific deadline time. Since the app, tests and most parts of the documentation already specify deadline to have the HHmm time format, I don't think there is a pressing need to remove it.

I thought this method was to output all the field of this default person as a String, meaning that it would be missing its default tag "Applicant" as part of the output here. Technically this method isn't being used yet, so I think its implementation would depend on how you would use it to test.

This case might not be solvable as the parseMultipleIndexes will parse the whole chunk till it reaches another known prefix.
If I do the current way, when doing the following commands:
- edit -i -10 -www
- edit -i 1 -www

You will get the error:
`Index must be a positive integer (non-zero, no leading signs).`

If I swap the checks, when doing the above commands, you get the following error:
`At least one field to edit must be provided.`

So its kinda how we want to prioritise it too.

Hmm this looks like the confirmation flag is always at position 1 but if a user provides extra spaces, this assumption might break. According to my good friend this could work better 
`Arrays.asList(splitArgs).contains(CONFIRMATION_KEYWORD)`

oh ya true, hmmmmmm then maybe need use regex for strict token matching

boolean isConfirmed = splitArgs.length > 1 && splitArgs[1].equalsIgnoreCase(CONFIRMATION_KEYWORD);'

Hmmm, I think it might be better to use the strict formatter HAHA
like I guess it would be better to inform the user that the reservation date is wrong rather than correcting it internally in the software. 

Possible problems e.g.
User can mistakenly book Feb 31 but system says reservation is full because system checks for Feb 28 reservations. 
Cld cause confusion I feel!

For this portion, it's more of tracked commands through stacks. Namely ```undoStack``` (and ```redoStack```).

- in the loop because it loops through '''personsToDelete'''
- out of the loop because it only creates one '''CommandResult'''

But the main reason behind this is because the diagram above does not cover the full flow.

Another way I thought of doing this would be to just loop the below portion:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f600df1-606a-4bfd-9f67-2c6a881243f7)

I'm not too sure what you mean by this part:
"The PendingConfirmation part runs first, meaning those objects are generated."

But i think you mean this: (FULL FLOW)
parse is invoked on LogicManager -&gt; parseConfirmation called on addressBookParser -&gt; executeConfirmed -&gt; commandTracker.getInstance() -&gt; CT.push() -&gt; parseCommand(...) -&gt; execute -&gt; commandResult

So there are a lot more moving parts that are currently not covered in this diagram. 
I think to make since it was unclear, I will add in the other parts for a more full diagram.

Small Edit: In this case, delete is being executed as if being directly confirmed

Would something like this be clearer? I think this captures the whole flow of ```Confirmable``` and ```Undoable```.
If yes, then let me know and Ill push the new changes.

**Note**: 
This is for single delete. As mentioned above for multiple delete, i intend to do this:

Also guys, I think we need don't merge yet because I think we need to change the priority of some of the stuff in the user stories. I've only included the ones marked as "high priority" in this document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GXGh9bbAZLjipCSq_Ox9PaKGIGcYV_fSwdZmUja52w4/edit?gid=0#gid=0 
but I think we need to change up the priority or refine the user stories so I'll keep it as a draft PR for now.

So far LGTM!
I think we just need to make sure that once we merge in our PRs, our testcases in ```test``` don't have conflicts.

@nictjh I think we'll do the same thing tomorrow where you merge in all the PRs, then we settle conflicts and do testing also.

Abstract out logic in '''Undo/Redo''' as '''UndoableCommand'''
My logic behind this is because not all commands should be lablled as `undoable`
Current '''UndoableCommand'''s are '''Add''' and '''Delete'''

I think it's from this portion.
Since it explicitly return an ```Optional.empty()``` for the optional fields.
It might not be worth to change up these fields due to possible existing dependencies of test cases.

But like what @Benjam11n mentioned, it would make the code excerpt more graceful / elegant.

> Not directly related to this PR but I found this interesting behaviour of our app as a result of testing this feature. When I try `undo` after a `find` command, the filters are reset. However, if I try` undo` after a `list` command with sorting, the sort will not be reset.

wait i think this is unintended behaviour. Can we get penalised for this?

> LGTM. I agree with Ben's comments. Is it possible to get the original list and restore the index there? Then we can say in the UG that undo guarantees restoring order in the original list. But you will know better how much effort this might take, so I think you'd decide.

I will take a look at this later. Might be a bit hard to make it non-buggy with the remaining time but i'll attempt it.

Edit: As ben mentioned, this is replicable with sort order on list

If I am not wrong, the predicate is inclusive so wouldn't it return all the reservations on the current day and the next day and hence all the timeslots in the 2 days or is this expected behavior?

Ok this is purely cosmetic and might be unnecessary, but since you created a `TimeSlot` class, why not let it have a `toString` method which formats each slot (the `formatTimeSlot` fn) so in your `formatFreeSlots` fn you can just put `slot` instead of calling another fn)

I believe `LocalDateTime.parse(".....")` parses dates to the nearest valid date, do you think its better if we use `DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("YYYY-MM-dd HHmm").withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle.STRICT);` which disallows invalid dates or make a note in our UserGuide stating it parses invalid dates to the nearest valid date?

So, the current field for reservations will only include name, phone and remark without considering the pax, table, start time, date, duration and ID (I thought as mentioned in github, we will need to input the id by ourselves for now instead of managed by the system)

IMO, I think maybe using ID would be faster, will be more convenient for the receptionist as he or she can navigate fast using id + date the customer book(since this is a unique key) instead of having to listrn , listrt to look for the index to edit when customer will call in and tell the receptionist to change the reservation details if any and even when they are paying using paynow (we can have the phone number .. imagine we have the system to interact with paynow). If not, the reservation id will not add any value since index are already there in my opinion, so maybe here is where the unique ID can contribute, I think. I am ok to edit the parameter to be ID instead of index ... since I code in a tentative manner, and it subjects to iterative changes.

Duplication entity depends on 3 criteria same time & same date & same last 4 digits. Thus, avoid using this combination while editing or adding reservation

Bro. Try to change your PR code to this for ReservationListPanel. You try first. Previously, for my side, your code does not change color immediately when it hits the regular amount of 3 for the previous 2 reservation.

Try to change the `Person.java` like this.

'''java
package seedu.address.model.reservation;

import static seedu.address.model.PersonsList.REGULAR_CUSTOMER_THRESHOLD;

public class Person ``{``
    private Phone phone;
    private Name name;
    private boolean isRegular = false;
    private int counter = 0;
    private int regularNum = 3;
    public Person() ``{``
        // Required for Jackson deserialization
    ``}``
    public Person(Name name, Phone phone) ``{``
        this.phone = phone;
        this.name = name;
    ``}``

    public Phone getPhone() ``{``
        return phone;
    ``}``

    public String getPhoneNumber() ``{``
        return phone.value;
    ``}``
    public Name getName() ``{``
        return name;
    ``}``

    public boolean isRegular() ``{``
        return isRegular;
    ``}``

    public boolean isRegularAmountHitted()``{``
        return this.counter >= REGULAR_CUSTOMER_THRESHOLD;
    ``}``

    public void setIsRegular(boolean isRegular) ``{``
        this.isRegular = isRegular;
    ``}``

    public int getCounter() ``{``
        return counter;
    ``}``

    public void setCounter(int counter) ``{``
        this.counter = counter;
    ``}``

``}``
'''
Try to change the line `p.isRegular()`  in `updateCardStyle` method under 'ReservationListPanel.java' to `p.isRegularAmountHitted()`

It should change the Initial UI appearance issue. Currently, whenever editing the UI will not reflect accordingly when the editing involves name or phone. Thus, I have discussed with @Jasonzhou97 and he will update accordingly.

@Frozennfishh  
For this issue, we will list down in the NFR. As our reservation id should be unique based on the combination, hence needs to say this one is the constraint.  If two reservation same id (very unlikely in real world based on our given combination), the first one will be edited. Hence, we need to put it in the NFR as constraint.

Nice work on the parse method! It looks generally clean and functional 
A few thoughts:

Maybe add validation for when tags are present but empty? Right now it accepts prefixes without values
Consider adding some tag format validation before passing to the command
Adding a try-catch around the index parsing could give more specific error messages

The overall structure looks good though - I like how you're checking for at least one prefix and handling the argument tokenization. Good job!

One small note: this checks if at least one prefix has any value (not empty), which works great with your parse method. If you also want to handle the case where prefixes exist but have empty values, you might need a separate check.

May I ask why the currentGrade is, by default, set to C? Would it work if you used some form of `""` or `null` by default instead when calling `CurrentGrade()` instead of `CurrentGrade(gradeString)`, such that we can then process it and dynamically hide the field if it reflects the default value in `PersonCard`?

This check might be incorrect; since `[cg/CURRENT_GRADE]` is `Optional`, should this check be setup in the way that it is?
Infact, I believe that it might be better to change this such that if it is equal to `null`, assign `currentGrade` to `new CurrentGrade()`.

What do you think?

Just a reminder that even if you eventually change CurrentGrade() to have a default constructor value of `""` or `null`, you can still leave this as it is, as @samuelkwik will be dynamically helping us deal with the fields after we merge all user stories of MVPs.

This depends on the Parsers and how they deal with it, because `""` is technically a valid `eduLevel`, especially if let's say we want to `edit` the Person to remove any existing education level. You're right, we should definitely test for this in the upcoming Smoke Test.

The intended use of the `payment` command is such that even if FEE is 0, by adding the PAYMENT_DATE, the user might want to store when they are expecting to "collect" payment without storing any FEE info. As such, I'll close this issue since it is not a bug.

Might be good to account for multiple spaces between indexes, as commands like `delete 1   2` will not work currently.

This is how the findCommandParser parses the keywords. Maybe a similar approach can be used here.

String[] nameKeywords = trimmedArgs.split("\\s+");

argMultimap.getValue(prefix) returns an Optional, and while the isPresent() check is done before calling this method, applying defensive programming here would improve robustness. I think using orElse("") here would be good.

Actually I have a question for this as well. Since we allow "/" for names containing s/o etc, this allows for some ambiguity as testers can intentionally enter commands like the one below to trick our system.

```
edit 1 n/Bernice n/Yu
```

This could be interpreted as:
1. Setting a single name field to "Bernice n/Yu" (where "n/Yu" is part of the name)

Yep, the console response does not use the toString method of person but instead formats it separately. I am not sure if the toString method of person is even used anywhere, other than tests.

I realised that this would be much harder than expected as now I have introduced generics into the Storage component...... There are now two new generic classes JsonStorage&lt;T, S extends JsonSerializable&lt;T>> and JsonSerializable&lt;T>.

Will do this in the near future.

1. All JsonSerializable classes will implement JsonSerializable&lt;T>. 
2. All JsonStorage classes extends JsonStorage&lt;T, S extends JsonSerializable&lt;T>>

Might be a little nitpicky but there might be some cases where the original order is not restored correctly. This happens when the list is sorted or filtered.

For example:

1. `list` (roy first, irfan second)
2. `find irfan` (irfan first)
3. `delete 1` (empty list)
4. `undo` (irfan becomes first)

The same thing should be replicable with sort. Not a huge issue though, so might not be worth the effort if this is hard to resolve.

Not directly related to this PR but I found this interesting behaviour of our app as a result of testing this feature. When I try `undo` after a `find` command, the filters are reset. However, if I try` undo` after a `list` command with sorting, the sort will not be reset.

Overall LGTM, it solves the issues of the previous implementation of the email validation. Not sure if its 100% correct since email validation is very complex, but should be able to account for most cases.

Ah... was the AB3 implementation to write `t/` and leave it blank to delete all tags?
This seems more like a UG bug than an implementation bug in that case.

I think these comments can be removed! Those that only describe what the code is doing does not seem very useful; As described in the textbook, they (comments) should not rephrase the code, but should be meant for other programmers explaining what the code is for and why, without the how.

One comment I have is that the box for the even indexed patients seems a bit too dark relative to the rest of the UI, so it doesn't mesh as well imo. What are your thoughts on this?

Hi! There's an issue with the CI atm

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e06a972-00be-459e-a9f0-b2568e1c8715)

Ideally make sure that the Action CI thing passes (sometimes need to rerun if it fails to confirm if it's actually failing or just being weird)

[How to rerun a specific job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs#re-running-a-specific-job-in-a-workflow)

I think it means you need to remove trailing whitespace to get the GitHub CI Action to pass?

Consider using Objects.equals() for null safety, e.g.:

        && Objects.equals(person.getDistrict(), otherMatch.person.getDistrict())

The constructor now takes an Index instead of a Person. This makes sense for a command that operates on a list index, but it shifts the responsibility of fetching the Person to the execute method. Good change for flexibility.
Suggestion: Consider adding a comment explaining why Index is preferred over Person (e.g., "Uses index to dynamically fetch the person from the model at runtime").

Conditional display of district and price is a clean way to handle optional fields in the UI.

Consider using a String.format or a utility method for the price formatting (e.g., "$%,d,000") to keep it consistent and reusable.

The System.out.println debugging statements should be removed before merging.

Just curious, and as a suggestion, since either index or or tutorial group needs to be non-null and not both, would it be better to overload the constructor instead, so the command would be shorter?

Noticed that the 13 fields are mandatory. May I know how would those with optional field be handled? E.g. Contact only in tutorial group and not in lab group.
Or would only csv exported from the address book would be allowed to be deserialized in the future?

Also, may I know how are the extra parts are handled if parts.length > expectedFields?

`isBothScorePresent` is an extension of `isLabScorePresent`. It is ok to reduce the checks because if`isBothScorePresent`  is true, then `isLabScorePresent `is true, but not vice versa.

No plans to implement the checksum calculation as of now, as the current checks is deemed sufficient. It is possible that the NRIC entered may be invalid. Similarly, the phone attribute is now only checked for >3 numbers, which is deemed sufficient and does not perform an OTP verification to verify if the phone number is actually correct.

Actually the code can be simplified further, since the day and date to find have been computed in the constructor for ScheduleContainsKeyword, so the isDayOfWeek conditional is not really necessary here. Only realised this after you helped to refactor the methods in the following lines. If possible can you help to simplify the code based on this logic?

Increased height of `ResultDisplay` `StackPane` so that the output will be more visible, especially for command usage. Otherwise, the user might not realise that there are examples given for `COMMAND` if they scroll down.

To reproduce (on default `addressbook.json`):
`assignment add aaa t/1`
`submission set submitted t/CS2103-T1 a/aaa s/2`
`Bernice Yu` who is not in `CS2103-T1` gets allocated the submission for `aaa` as seen in `submission list`:

No changes needed but, you should avoid using logic directly. By right MainWindowController should not have access to logic, only MainWindowViewModel. So the by right way should be:
`MainWindowController` -&gt; `MainWindowVM.currentWeekProperty()` -&gt; `return meetingListVM.currentWeekProperty()`

`MeetingListVM` should take in logic and subscribe to the currentWeekProp from logic

This pattern isn't considered good practice, since you are accessing a very distant variable. Generally it's good to limit to calling methods from the direct neighbours (i.e. Model), and not further (i.e. methods in Group or GroupMemberDetail). Don't know if they will grade our code quality though.

Note: There are some issues with the checkstyle, regarding public access to fields.

Perhaps could add a validation check that latitude and longitude is within -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 respectively.
Example:
public Location(String postalCode, String address, double latitude, double longitude) ``{``
    requireAllNonNull(postalCode, address);
   
    if (latitude &lt; -90 || latitude > 90) ``{``
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Latitude must be between -90 and 90 degrees, got: " + latitude);
    ``}``
    
    if (longitude &lt; -180 || longitude > 180) ``{``
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Longitude must be between -180 and 180 degrees, got: " + longitude);
    ``}``
    
    this.postalCode = postalCode;
    this.address = address;
    this.latitude = latitude;
    this.longitude = longitude;
``}``

The number format exception might be due to Integer.parseInt trying to parse INVALID_PROGRESS_DESC which does not contain any int. Hence, number format exception is thrown.

### Operating System: Mac
### Things to note:
- [x] Ensure that the app is able to reset from a corrupted/incorrect JSON file.
- [x] Ensure that the app is able to work from an empty `data` folder.
- [x] Take note of the starting Student Records (I recommend starting from `clear`)
### Things to check for:
- [x] Ensure that the program works
- [x] Add command is working as intended
- [x] Edit command is also working as intended
- [x] Optional fields are indeed optional
- [x] Payment Command is working as intended
- [x] Test for Storage Persistence along the way (Maybe even after each command?)
- [x] Ensure that the GUI is correct at all times
- [x] Ensure GUI can scale correctly despite the GUI updates.
- [x] Ensure that Invalid Command Usage warning is a correct reflection of the command update.
- [x] Try out the rest of the command as well.

The message invalid command format and an example coupled with the format listed on the command guide section is enough to explain the error. Moreover, if we have a special error message for one special case, we'll have to consider all the many combinations of faulty inputs and their corresponding error messages.

I believe we cannot merge this PR at the moment, as the codebase is broken, and merging now would result in too many errors to fix in future iterations, as much more complex functions get added.

My suggestion is to proceed with the following steps (in order):
1. Revert to the most recent commit where the codebase passes all (unmodified) test cases. This ensures we start from a stable foundation.
2. Rename the classes using the IDE‚Äôs(IntelliJ) refactoring tools, following the naming conventions we've agreed upon. This step will help us maintain a functioning codebase moving forward. 
3. Once the class renaming is completed, we can collaboratively work on the add and delete commands. We can split the work by components, and each of us can handle the necessary modifications and relevant tests.

I believe it is **critical** to have a working code base at the beginning of step 3. 

Additionally, for Step 2, we should avoid manually adding or renaming classes, as it‚Äôs easy to overlook errors. Using the IDE‚Äôs refactoring tools is essential to ensure accuracy and consistency.

The bug was related to the mass-delete function, where if the student ids were interleaved such that some were valid and others were invalid, some of the valid student ids do not get deleted, even if they exist.

I am doing the same thing as your filter command, except my sd time is selected date 0000 and ed time is next day 0000.    Even if there is a reservation for next day 0000, it will check whether that reservation and ed have a 1 hr gap inbetween. So it would not add that in.

WTD if you accidentally coded, committed and pushed on `master` in your own fork

1. Create a new branch, name it whatever
2. Do a small change, commit on **this specific branch**
3. Type these commands into CLI:

`git checkout master` (brings you back to master)

`git reset --hard HEAD~1` (reverts by `1` commit, please adjust based on how many commits to rollback on)

`git push --force origin master` (pushes these reverted changes to master, --force required as it's a backward change)

Now your `master` branch should be back to its original state, and the new branch contains all your changes!

The new addition (Optionally, allows users to redeem reward points to pay for the purchase.) improves clarity by highlighting the redemption feature early. This ensures that users understand all functionalities upfront. Good improvement considering our User Guide feedback earlier on.

The ind/INDEX syntax was removed, making it purchase INDEX ....
If this is an intentional syntax update, ensure consistency across all documentation and commands. The [redeem/true] notation correctly conveys that it is optional, which is a good addition.
Consider mentioning explicitly that omitting this will default to a regular purchase?

The 100 points = $1 explanation is helpful. Because I was previously curious about how the point system works as well, when reading the PurchaseCommand.java. The visit count rule is correctly reiterated for redemptions, preventing confusion.

Great refactor towards better OOP design! By making Person abstract and using getFilteredList(Staff.class), this change improves maintainability for Staff and Customer.

Yo, I get what you're saying about LSP. Right now, isSamePerson works differently for Person and Customer. For Person, it's just comparing names, but for Customer, it's using phone numbers. So, if we treat a Customer as a Person, the results might not be what we expect.

Making Person abstract could help since it stops isSamePerson from having a default behavior and having the isSamePerson method in Person as an abstract method makes sense since it forces all subclasses to define their own logic.

**12 :octicon-git-pull-request::octicon-comment:** (commented on others PR)

I see your concern. I think the main issue might be that getFilteredList(Class&lt;T> type) uses unchecked casting. Since Person is now abstract and we have different subclasses like Staff and Customer, the list will contain mixed types.

What if a part of the code expects only Staff but accidentally gets a Customer? That could cause unexpected errors at runtime. Maybe we should check if there's a safer way to filter without risking type issues. Do you think we should add tests to catch potential errors early?

I think can rephrase to something along the line of:
Searching by `NAME` allows for **one misspelled** or **missing** letter per word in the name (e.g. first name, surname...). 
When a `NAME` is entered, only contacts whose names contain the `NAME` keyword or closely match the entire `NAME` keyword will be shown.

For export, because the user may create a new folder, there are checks whether the folder path name is valid before creating the folder. For import, nothing is created, and if the path is invalid, this will throw an exception informing the user that the path does not exist, and prompts the user to do things like checking spelling or choosing another path...

@junngithub Do you make a cutoff to the closeness score? My initial intention when doing this is that you will list everything from most to least relevant, so this miscommunication and implementation error on how this should behave is on my side. I could not do anything with this (that is how edit distance works, and not enough time to find an entirely new closeness score algorithm), so just bear with it and make sure to specify that within the UG and DG, thank you üôè .

I see where the confusion is. when adding a new person:

AddCommandParser --> method `parse` calls ParserUtil.parseName which formats the name before assigning it to the person instance

When editing a person through PersonBuilder class via method `withName`, it directly accesses the name field and reassigns its value (without going through formatting in parserUtil.)

I edited add command to be case insensitive for names so theoretically 'ALICE pauline' and 'Alice Pauline' should be an exact match ie. this code chunk should return true with no likely similarity.

thoughts on editing the withName function to be case insensitive or perhaps to run it through parseName?

I think its fine because the (X) cross in the diagram just indicates that at that point the object is no longer referenced and ready to be garbage collected, not that its being destroyed at the point in the diagram which lines up with what you said :)

Since the purpose of the `toDisplayString` is to create a string viewable by the user, it may be a better user experience if the strings displayed to the user are the same strings they enter in the command line. Thus, the `fromString()` and `toString()` commands should be consistent.

Using indexes to identify a personcard's default state works well when a contact is updated. However, indexes of all cards change when a contact is deleted, leading to a completely different set of person cards to be expanded instead. 

Since you already have access to a `Person` object in the constructor, would you like to use a `HashMap` to store the states based on the org id instead? Preferably, you would have to handle the case when the org id itself is updated.

Maybe can add the troubleshoot step also? like to solve this issue, can try deleting vitabook.json and rerun the application. But also remember to backup the file before deleting, etc.

I think the logic for requiring a confirmation can be abstracted for reuse with other commands such as Delete or Undo.

Maybe create a class extending Command called ConfirmationCommand or smt, and have commands like Clear extend that instead. The logic can be implemented there instead. AddressBookParser can then check for whether any ConfirmationCommand is currently active, only executing it upon a confirmation, while also disallowing other inputs other than Y/N during this.

From the textbook
```
Problems in NFRs. Examples:

Not really a Non-Functional Requirement
Not scoped clearly (i.e., hard to decide when it has been met)
Not reasonably achievable
Highly relevant NFRs missing
```
Try to ensure that the NFRs are more concrete, such that it is clear when a NFR has been met. Can follow some examples from [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week7/project.html#non-functional-requirements).

When running this command, the response from the system is Viewing sessions for household: H000003. The sessions window also does not seem to display "Listed all sessions for household H000003:" as indicated in the UG.

However, for the following PRs, might be good to:
1. Split PRs according to their purpose in future- easier to track the purpose of each PR.
2. Please ensure EOF has a newline, and no trailing whitespaces.

Using exceptions as flow control should be avoided (though I used, can't figure out any other way). Instead, you can use regex for this. 
The regex used is: `\\b(1[0-9]``{``2``}``|[2-9][0-9]``{``2,``}``)\\b`. This pattern matches numbers between 100 - 199 (1 followed by two digits) or 200 and above (2-9 followed by at least two digits).

You're right - however PR #144 updates the code to disallow the provision of index and phone number in one delete command. 

As this is an edge case that I hope will be removed with the merging of PR #144, I chose not to mention it.

Yes, that's what I've got in mind. For now, I think the management of stagnant files and restoration of backups can be left up to the user. I've already made the requisite changes and can issue a PR to your branch.

Hi, I took a look and some possibly unexpected behaviour (doesn't align with what we discussed) seems to still be occurring:

![img1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1507159-5808-48ed-ab48-2838bc09b705)

After a save command is issued with a filename parameter, the old file is destroyed and a new file is created with the specified filename, as expected.

But if successive commands are issued (e.g. delete in this case), a new file is created with the same filename as the previously deleted file. All subsequent updates go to this file.  If the application is restarted, it correctly uses the new user-specified savefile. 

If JsonAddressBookStorage's saveAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook, Path) method is modified to also update JsonAddressBookStorage's filePath private variable, this problem goes away.

Hi, I've taken a look at your latest commit. The app is working, but I'm now frankly confused as to what form our save feature is/should be taking.

As of this latest commit, the save command has the following behaviour when given a filename parameter NEW_FILENAME:

1. Creates a new save file in the data directory called NEW_FILENAME.json and saves NEW_FILENAME to preferences.json
2. Subsequent changes within the same session continue being saved to original save file (?)
3. Upon restarting of the application, NEW_FILENAME is loaded and changes made within this new session are saved to NEW_FILENAME

Side note: if a save command is issued in a session, and the application is restarted, save commands in the new session seem to create additional files without purging older save files. This could clutter the directory. 

Following the discussion in #100 : I was under the impression that when a save command is issued with a filename parameter it should behave as follows,
 
1. It should effectively just change the save file's path
2. The save command should not function as an archive-type command
3. Only one file should exist in the data directory to prevent clutter

That is, if the user starts the application with a save file named arthive.json, and issues a save command with filename parameter (e.g. save NEW_FILENAME), the command should delete arthive.json, save the current contents to NEW_FILENAME.json, and save all future changes in the current session to NEW_FILENAME.json. Additionally, user preferences are updated to reflect the use of NEW_FILENAME.json in subsequent sessions. 

@0x4F776C @kennethsoh @CJ-783 @broccoli-hater requesting your input as I fear that I might be misunderstanding a critical feature in our application. A discussion about this might help us ensure the user guide is clear and unambiguous.

Really sorry to harp on this - it looks like right now the command format is specified as `tag p/PHONE t/TAG [t/TAG]..`, when it should be `tag p/PHONE t/TAG [t/TAG]‚Ä¶`. 

A single ellipsis character ‚Ä¶ is used (instead of 3 full stops) to indicate that an item can be used multiple times including zero times.

I've done a little bit of investigation. This is the error that ArtHive throws on startup when the given replication procedure is followed.

```
INFO: JSON file data/arthive.json found.
Mar 22, 2025 3:39:36 PM seedu.address.storage.JsonAddressBookStorage readAddressBook
INFO: Illegal values found in data/arthive.json: Emails should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:
1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
The domain name must:
    - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
    - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
    - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

```

Upon further investigation, this bug does not occur if an email address is supplied in step 2. I checked the .json file and found that when no email address is supplied, the contact is created like so: 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdf14b23-cabc-41fe-b23b-36c0bce214c1)

The absence of an email being saved in this manner is the probable cause of the bug.

The reason for the long method is that it's not possible to throw exceptions within lambdas, which forces unwrapping of optionals. This is a common issue across the codebase. Admittedly, I rewrote parts of the parser to be more readable, at the expense of brevity. 

I've shortened the parse method in SetStatusCommandParser as much as possible - I think the current length should be ok.

After much thoughts, it might be better to leave it as Tags/Projects. if we write `TAG`/`PROJECT`, it suggests we're referring to exact placeholders in the command (like t/TAG or project/PROJECT), but here, we're explaining the effect of the command (removing tags/projects from a contact), not the syntax.

However, thanks for raising this!, I will go through other commands to add in back-ticks to make it consistent throughput the document

For point 3 if I understand you correctly, you are suggesting that if a user were to run the save command with filename parameter, it would create a backup file which will not be modified

Instead of modifying the current "save" command to handle both saving and backing up, perhaps it would be better if we add this feature in a separate functionality in the future rather than in the MVP version.

Although I understand the intent of creating this backup functionality automatically when we run the save command, I feel like the save command should retain its core functionality, which is to just save it into the arthive.json. 

Perhaps in the future, we can introduce a new feature specifically for creating backup of the file with a separate command, which would allow the user to save a copy of their data without affecting the active save file.

Perhaps it might be helpful to split this regex into smaller, more manageable parts to pinpoint the exact issue more clearly and address each rule individually. This would allow the user to know exactly what the issue is (e.g. If the user enters an incorrect phone number, Arthive could tell them that the phone number is incorrect, rather than providing a generic error about the input.). 

What are your thoughts @kennethsoh

Will be splitting the regex into smaller, more manageable parts to pinpoint the exact issue more clearly and address each rule individually.

@FadhilPM 
I think it might be a good idea to make the resolution smaller, or reduce some of the command listed here. When the help command is executed, the window is too large where I can't move the window.

The screenshot below shows my entire screen when I execute it

It makes sense to make the command with extendibility in mind. I guess one way to adapt it for this would be to require a prefix flag like `deleteall t/&lt;tagname>`? But I think it's fine to leave it as it is for 1.4.

The list scrollbar no longer works correctly
- Clicking on the scrollbar causes it to reset to the top
- Dragging does not work until you drag the mouse very far down
- Mouse scrollwheel still works

2. add the example contact (in the response box)
3. attempt to use scrollbar

Just wanted to comment thatI think there can always be an argument regarding how the find function operates. 
Like the old AB3 find wont find Hans Zimmer using "find Han" but yours does. Maybe future implementation can have a find and a strict find function.

For MVP I think this implementation suffices.

For example, how about using these notations?

I'm assuming from jobs this will specifically be job titles/positions, correct? 
From the description of @Zonnie-23, this would be:
"In this increment, to identify an applicant's possible role in the company, there would be 9 main job position to choose from

Back-end Developer (To handle the server side of the application)

Product Manager

> Reduce information in PersonCard to improve readability
Have an additional element for users to view detailed information regarding each candidate when selected
Additionally also have a command / some form of keyboard navigation for users to be able to select each individual contact

With regard to this, I believe it will be the main focus to start with as it closely aligns with the UI mockup our team has. Due to the time constraints, I will add this to the next milestone. Meanwhile, I will basically update the theme of our UI such that it is similar to our mockup.

Unsure, the original `EditCommand` seems to disallow editing of remarks. We can open an issue to change this in subsequent PRs?

I agree, I think this is best done by relooking at inheritance relationships of Customer/Staff. This again might be the task of another issue in another PR?

This seems like behaviour for Customer.class to manage. Perhaps a factory class in Customer.class would be good here?

Similarly, Staff.java could also have this.

However, I am afraid of violation of LSP.
- given x = Person with name "X"
- given y = Person with name "Y"
- x.isSamePerson(y) is false

however, if x and y are Customers,
- x.isSamePerson(y) could be true.

I think this issue can mitigated if we define Person as an abstract class (Person::isSamePerson has no behaviour to inherit).

Note that commands have been refactored too. Instead of adding to a large switch table in ParseCommand, we add each command to a map as shown here:

'''java
    static ``{``
        COMMAND_MAP.put(AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD, arguments -&gt; new AddCommandParser().parse(arguments));
        COMMAND_MAP.put(EditCommand.COMMAND_WORD, arguments -&gt; new EditCommandParser().parse(arguments));
        COMMAND_MAP.put(DeleteCommand.COMMAND_WORD, arguments -&gt; new DeleteCommandParser().parse(arguments));
        COMMAND_MAP.put(ClearCommand.COMMAND_WORD, arguments -&gt; new ClearCommand());
        COMMAND_MAP.put(FindCommand.COMMAND_WORD, arguments -&gt; new FindCommandParser().parse(arguments));
        COMMAND_MAP.put(RemarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD, arguments -&gt; new RemarkCommandParser().parse(arguments));
        COMMAND_MAP.put(ListCommand.COMMAND_WORD, arguments -&gt; new ListCommand());
        COMMAND_MAP.put(ExitCommand.COMMAND_WORD, arguments -&gt; new ExitCommand());

@Jsjk112344 While looking at this issue, noticed that we have `testutils/StaffBuilder` and `testutils/CustomerBuilder` that acts as a factory method. Could we reuse that code instead? We might then move `testutils` to its own folder instead.

This is workable. In addition, we can review whether we want seperate commands for adding customers.

We had prior feedback in CS2101 that customeradd is not as intuitive as addcustomer. We can put effort to enure that:
- add customer
- add staff

are valid commands instead.

Right, currently the method filters the internal representation of staff/customer list. We can fix this with something like

We correct for this issue by refactoring Find entirely. We will use closest matches, therefore whether it is the first or last name does not matter. Simply a close enough match is sufficient to search for names.

This is only done for names because it is easy for it to have mistakes. Every other field howevever must be precise to ensure no mistake in finding.

Personally I find it cleaner if we list all of the parameters on their own line, if there are so many required parameters. This is especially since each parameter has its own associated `@JsonProperty` decorator.

This is fine for now, but we should do an overall code quality + style pass after hitting v1.3.

@ho-thanh-und  I think for this one. What can we do if the list is empty is to notify the user. For example:
```
2a. The list is empty
    2a1.Notify user about the empty list
```
Other than that, I think the index looks correct since it indicates an alternative path to `2. QuickHire shows the list of applicants`

I think the current AB3 project we cloned from already has a similar kind of function when we press 'help' it will show us the link to the instructions of the project.

> Functionality wise, quite thorough in terms of dealing with all aspects of scheduling. Food for thought: Should schedule really be a parallel data book? I believe you are using the name and email as the primary key to uniquely identify each person. Great job. But with this much changes, more test cases needs to be added to ensure that there are no serious bugs, especially ensure that the two are synchronised and anything such as email or name is changed, these changes are reflected in the parallel schedule book.

Oh thank you for your comment. For your concern of syncronization, I have ensured when the user's info is edited, the information will be also reflected in the shcedule board.

Is this screenshot capturing the application in its full screen ? I wonder how it looks like if the user resizes the application into smaller screen.

> Thanks for addressing the issues! In terms of the UI, I think the display for the interview schedule part might look a bit off as it's the only section which has a title. If we decide on having these section titles, maybe we could add it to the other two sections as well? This is a minor issue and low priority. Other than that, LGTM!

Hi @Zonnie-23, could you help add a heading title for the candidate list as well in the PR #140 ?

I may need you to describe the whole issue you encountered so that I can fully understand what you mean then I can make changes accordingly.

Not sure why the test is failing. The JSON file appears to parse incorrectly for Alice specifically -- the following is the error message (trimmed for relevance) that is achieved by running `./gradlew clean test --tests seedu.innsync.storage.JsonSerializableAddressBookTest.toModelType_typicalPersonsFile_success`.

`org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: ...name=Alice Pauline, ..., tags=[friends], starred=false``}``... but was:  ...name=Alice Pauline, ..., tags=[], starred=false``}``...`

Oddly enough this only happens when running `clean test`. Running `test` twice will cause the test to fail on the first run but pass on the second run. Would appreciate any input on this :(

Good validation attempt, but is it possible that this could potentially run us into errors after the event is over? Or is a wedding instance removed from storage after local time exceeds the date of the wedding?

This might be slightly inconvenient to type out findmember each time bc its a long string, typically written separately. For user experience purposes, maybe you could use something like ``{`` find m/ MEMBER_NAME ``}`` instead?

Actually I think keeping it as changeTheme works ok here, mainly because the boolean represents whether or not we should change the theme

Yes i was also wondering about this but these are mainly helper functions to abstract way having to call .equals everywhere else, scalability shouldnt be an issue if we keep adding themes. Especially because it just seems like a very low priority to add anything beyond light or dark. Maybe a tritonopia/colour correction theme for those with colour blindness but I dont see more than that unless because that would just be beyond the main scope of what our application is even trying to do

> Just a few nitpicks on code quality issues. I think the main ones are:
> 
> 1. variable `changeTheme`: Can be changed to `hasChangedTheme`
> 2. method `isChangeTheme`: Can be changed to `shouldChangeTheme`
> 3. an additional constructor for CommandResult that omits `hasChangedTheme` (or `changeTheme` if the name remains) can remove the need for `*Command` classes that do not modify the theme to explicitly state it as `false`.

Consider replacing this with Objects.requireNonNull(predicate, "Predicate should be initialized"); for more consistent null checking. assert statements may be disabled in production, which could allow a null to slip through unnoticed.

The new assertions are currently not covered by tests, which is causing the Codecov patch check to fail. You could add a test case that executes this command with a valid predicate and model to ensure those lines are exercised.

As this command grows in logic, you might consider extracting the filtered list logic or message generation into a helper method. For now it's fine, but worth keeping in mind for readability.

Yes it means to input index1, index2 or range of indexes. The part inside the square brackets is optional (for specifying multiple indexes). Not sure if writing it this way is clear enough though

model.getFilteredPersonList().size() ‚Äî Just a heads-up: since this command filters tenants, should this be getFilteredTenantList() instead of getFilteredPersonList()? Looks like a possible inconsistency with naming.

Note to future readers: `UniqueList.remove` usually uses `Objects.equals` which would fail here, but `UniqueAttendanceRecordList` overrides `remove` implementation in this PR, which makes it okay.

You could add unit tests for:

SortCommandParser to cover:
Invalid prefix combos (e.g., -n true -e false)
Unsupported formats

Comparators themselves (e.g., assert that NameComparator sorts alphabetically)

ModelManager#sortPerson() integration test

‚úÖ Overall:
Clean implementation that adds great functionality and fits TrackUP‚Äôs UX model.

this line is not entirely true. you could have a newName == currName. but newDeadline != currDeadline. it is only a duplicate entry if all field are equal. 
Perhaps you could 
'''java 
public void editAssignment(String assignmentName, String newName, LocalDate deadline) ``{``
    Assignment editedAssignment = new Assignment(newName, deadline);
    for (Assignment a : assignments) ``{``
        if (a.equals(editedAssignment)) ``{``
            throw new DuplicateAssignmentsException():
        ``}``
    ``}``

Currently, the code implicitly sorting the weddings in ascending date order. Maybe In the future, the user wants a descending order. The code may consider making the sort criteria explicit or providing another command option in the future round.

The command is user-friendly and neat now, but considering that sorting can have different logic, the command may explicitly show the logic behind sorting like datesort, reversedatesort, just a suggestion if sorting functionality is becoming more complicated in the future.

I appreciate this safety measure to prevent a `NoSuchElementException` when `Optional::get()` is called!

Maybe we could convert all the ParseUtil methods to accept `Optional` as arguments instead to avoid this problem...
(to retain the previous format and prevent the need for 2 lines of code per student attribute in this `parse` method)

e.g.
`AddCommandParser.java`
```
Details details = ParserUtil.parseDetails(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_DETAILS));
```
...
`ParserUtil.java`
```
    public static Details parseDetails(Optional<String> details) ``{``
        requireNonNull(detailsOptional);
        return detailsOptional
            .map(String::trim)
            .map(Details::new)
            .orElse(new Details(""));
        ``}``
```

With regards to the previous comment in `AddCommandParser.java`, we could also use `isPresent()` as we do here, but I feel that it may increase repetition.

Now that you mention it... thanks for notifying!
Do we want to change tutorial to a class or shall we just do away with this feature altogether?

Name searches should be case-insensitive.
1. Usability and User Experience
  - Users would need to remember the exact case of each letter. Not helpful.
2. Industry standard
  - Most apps and search engines implement case-insensitive name search by default. eg Google, Contacts

Great job on creating typical test data for Patients. Test case cover a wide variety of scenarios which is helpful for validating the code,

A couple of suggestions:
- It might be useful to add some test cases with missing &lt;Optional> fields, eg. patient with just name and address etc..
- For improved readability, consider standardizing the format of patient creation, as some lines have method chains while others are more spread out.

Looks Good, but code coverage dropped due to some lines not being covered by tests. Will attempt to bring coverage back up in the next PR.

# Unprescribe Command Bug Report
## Bug 1: `unprescribe` Command provides incorrect error message when invalid index provided

**Main Issue:**
`unprescribe` Command provides incorrect error message when certain invalid indexes are provided

**Description:**
When executing the `unprescribe` command with certain invalid indexes (like `-1`, `0` and `-1000`), the error message provided is `incorrect command format!` instead of `The patient index provided is invalid`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application
2. Ensure there is at least 1 patient in the list (Alex Yeoh at index 1)
3. Execute the command: `unprescribe -1 m/paracetamol`
4. Observe the output message: "Invalid command format! 
unprescribe: removes a medication from the patient specified by the index number used in the last patient listing. Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) m/[medicine name] OR m/all
Example 1: unprescribe 1 m/Paracetamol"

**Expected Behavior:**
The system should reject the command and display an error message indicating an invalid index: `The patient index provided is invalid`

**Actual Behavior:**
The system rejects the command, but displays an `incorrect command format!` error

**Documentation Reference:**
According to the command documentation:
Removes specific or all medication from an existing patient in the patient contact book.

Format: `unprescribe INDEX m/MEDICINE_NAME` or `unprescribe INDEX m/all`

* Removes medication from the patient at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index 
  number shown in the displayed patient list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã
* `unprescribe INDEX m/all` removes all medication from the list 

**Severity:**
Low - The command executes correctly, but the error message could confuse the user, since the command format is technically correct.

**Suggested Fix:**
Modify the command parser to validate that an index of 0 and below (negative) should return the invalid index error message (`The patient index provided is invalid`).

## Bug 2: `unprescribe` command allows multiple medicines to be specified but only removes first medicine specified

**Main Issue:**
`unprescribe` command allows multiple medicines to be specified but only removes the last medicine specified

**Description:**
When executing the `unprescribe` command, the user can specify multiple medicines to be removed but only the last medicine specified gets removed.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application
2. Ensure there is at least 1 patient in the list (Alex Yeoh at index 1), and this patient has at least two medicines (e.g. Insulin and Paracetamol)
3. Execute the command: `unprescribe 1 m/Insulin m/Paracetamol`
4. Observe that the system reports `Removed medication Paracetamol from patient: Alex Yeoh`

**Expected Behavior:**
The system should either:
- Inform the user that only 1 medicine can be specified at a time
OR
- Remove all specified medicines (if all are valid) from the specified patient

**Actual Behavior:**
The system displays a success message `Removed medication Paracetamol from patient: Alex Yeoh` and only removes the last specified medication (Paracetamol in this case).

**Severity:**
Medium - This issue provides misleading feedback to users but doesn't cause data loss or prevent functionality.

**Suggested Fix:**
Modify the `unprescribe` command implementation to:
1. Remove all specified medicines from the specified patient, and display the appropriate success message accordingly IF everything is correct (valid medicine names, valid index, patient has all of the medicines specified... etc)

**Screenshot:**

FYI, i actually merged my code from branch-jake-incrementAdd5 into this branch. This is because my build would have failed since the functionality of the priority tags are mainly in branch-jake-incrementAdd5 , so i need merge it into this branch for me to pass the build tests.

Since `generateDayOfWeekRegex()` is being called every time `isDayOfWeek` is called, maybe you can just save them as constants like so:


`private static final String DAY_OF_WEEK_REGEX = generateDayOfWeekRegex();`
`private static final Pattern DAY_OF_WEEK_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("(?i)(" + DAY_OF_WEEK_REGEX + ")");`

Could consider changing this to index instead of patientIndex since it is accepting all index and the check will determine if it is a patient or nurse

I do think this is a really useful feature but I'm just wondering how this will be shown to the user? will it also be in blocks, which means that there are 3 different lists (person, wedding, tasks for specified wedding) of blocks total? or should we display all the tasks already when we call for wedding list?

For this feature, I think a typically workflow for the User would be to list tasks for a certain wedding, then mark/unmark it (as he may not be sure of the index), so do you think we can remove the need to include weddingID in the command?

It did happen to me, and I looked through the test. But I think it is acceptable for that failure to return warning given by `EditCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE`, as it is a test failure from EditCommandParseTest.java. 
Imo it is worse when the `StudentId.MESSAGE_CONSTRAINT` is set to an EditCommand error message, as the error message can be triggered whenever there's a violation in `StudentId` format, which was what happened in our Add Command smoke test.

TLDR, I made that particular test failure expects an error message from EditCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE instead of StudentId.MESSAGE_CONSTRAINT. Essentially it still outputs the same message, just from a different source.

I think instead of manual string manipulation, perhaps use the ArgumentMultimap and ArgumentTokenizer class to parse arguments. It is already prebuilt into AB3, and i think it would forgo the need to do the for-loop to search for multiple tags :O can refer to the add/edit command to see how they used the tokenizer to get multiple tags at once

I've reviewed the changes and they look good to merge. The changes correctly:

- Update the customeradd command to properly include customer ID in both the example usage and success message
- Update the staffadd command to include staff ID in the success message
- Change the help URL to point to our CafeConnect website

These changes improve the user experience by providing clearer command feedback and directing users to our project-specific documentation. All tests are passing and the implementation follows our coding standards.

Approving this PR which fixes issues #184 and #171.

Would it make sense to check if historyPointer actually changes before updating the text field? Currently, if the user presses UP at the first command or DOWN at the last command, the historyPointer is first updated before checking if it is already at the limit. Adding an early return when historyPointer is at its limit might improve efficiency.

When set to null or "", some bugs arise due to validation checks by the ParserUtil and CurrentGrade files because they cannot differentiate between an intialised empty String value "" and a user input empty String value "". Will create a seperate issue for this bug later and will set the validation check to allow empty String user inputs for now. Thanks for clarifying too!

I believe the major difference between AddCommandParser.java and EditCommandParser.java is the fact that EditCommandParser.java assumes that there is some valid String value stored in the argMultimap.

Should the processing logic for tutorials be extracted into a helper method? It seems like the constructor is handling inline transformation, which might affect readability and Single Level of Abstraction Principle. An extracted method could improve clarity and reusability. 

'''suggestion
        this.tutorials = formatTutorials(source.getTutorials());
``}``

private static String formatTutorials(List&lt;Tutorial> tutorials) ``{``
    return tutorials.stream().map(Tutorial::toString).collect(Collectors.joining(TUTORIALS_SEPARATOR));
``}``
'''

I‚Äôm not entirely sure, but this could potentially violate SLAP as it currently handles both cmds and subcmds within the same method. Would it make sense to separate the parsing of subcommands into a different function, such as parseSubcmds, to improve single responsibility?

Thank you for your comment and suggestion! I understand your point about potentially simplifying the parsing logic by passing Optional directly into the ParserUtil methods. However, I prefer to maintain the current structure where the command parsers handle validation specific to their context, while ParserUtil focuses solely on parsing the input. This way, the responsibilities are more clearly separated, and each class remains focused on its core function. Thanks again for sharing your thoughts!

I think shifting it to `FindCommandParser` will be better as the other user stories that we came up with doesn't seem to need Prefixes.

This was an intentional change. I was trying to give a clearer error message. Because when the command `find c/` is entered without any comment keywords, the previous error message was "Comments must not exceed 500 characters" which did not make sense when no keywords was inputed.

The team is using Jekyll for the website. 
Refer [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/appendixE-gitHub.html#tp-team-repo-setup) to see the difference between Jekyll and Markbind. 
Would be good to familiarise yourself with the current product website version.

Additionally, your master branch is out-of-date with the upstream repo. It should not be an issue but remember to sync fork and git pull periodically.

Typo: I think it should be FindClientAndCommand object instead of FindClientOrCommand object.

I was thinking: Is the case for FindClientCommand (line 75) still necessary since FindClientCommand class is now abstract?

I think deleting multiple clients at once can be risky too, as we only separate the indices using whitespace. User may accidentally delete the wrong client due to typos. For example, if he wants to delete client 4, 5 and 6 and keyed in "deleteclient 45 6", client 45 and 6 will be deleted instead.  By only allowing deletion of clients one at a time, it will be clear to the user which client he/she is deleting and prevent accidental deletion.

I tested the code and noticed that the find command for property only matches property names exactly and does not return results for partial or substring matches. Just wondering if this an intentional design choice? Substring support could potentially improve usability, but I can also see value in keeping it strict for clarity.

Saw that the threshold is set to allow a 5% drop in coverage, just curious if this was based on our current coverage trend, or more of a placeholder for now? Might be something to adjust later once testing stabilises.

This message works functionally, but it might be helpful to make it more descriptive for the user, maybe something like "Client cannot be deleted because they are linked to an open deal, upcoming event, or existing property". That way, users immediately understand why the action failed without having to guess.

</div>

The new logic for preventing deletion of a client based on existing deals, events, or properties makes a lot of sense, it adds a nice layer of safety. That said, since this introduces multiple branching checks so it might be valuable to write dedicated test cases for each scenario. That way, we can be confident that each constraint works as intended and independently blocks deletion when it should.

Changes made:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Fixed execute_allFieldsSpecifiedUnfilteredList_success() test to correctly expect the persistent [friend] tag inherited from TypicalPersons.AMY.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Updated execute_someFieldsSpecifiedUnfilteredList_success() to align with the actual EditCommand behavior, where new tags (e.g., "husband") are added to the guest while retaining existing tags.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Ensured CommandTestUtil.java correctly defines TAG_DESC_HUSBAND and TAG_DESC_FRIEND using the right CLI prefix (PREFIX_TAG instead of PREFIX_ADD_REQ).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Verified that tests now reflect the application‚Äôs tag-additive logic, i.e., existing tags persist unless explicitly removed.

Notes:
	‚Ä¢	The logic for persistent tags is now consistently handled in both the command and the test cases.
	‚Ä¢	The application allows tags to be added via +req/ syntax and removed via -req/, ensuring correct UI feedback (e.g., [brother][friends] after adding "brother").

‚∏ª

Testing:
	‚Ä¢	Ran all EditCommandTest.java tests; all pass successfully.
	‚Ä¢	Verified through manual testing in the app:
	‚Ä¢	edit 1 +req/brother correctly adds "brother" while preserving "friends".
	‚Ä¢	edit 1 -req/brother correctly removes "brother" while preserving "friends".

Removed test case: 
	‚Ä¢	File name: EditCommandParserTest.java
	‚Ä¢	Test name: parse_resetTags_success()
This test is now obsolete due to the new tag mutation logic.
Previously, an empty `t/` (TAG_EMPTY) prefix was used to reset all tags, but the updated EditCommand no longer supports clearing tags via t/ alone.
Instead, tags are mutated incrementally using +req/ and -req/ prefixes.
Therefore, this reset behavior is no longer part of the parser or command flow.

Issue: Improve EditCommand to Support Incremental Tag Mutations

Summary

Currently, the EditCommand tests and application logic revealed inconsistencies in how tags (also referred to as ‚Äúrequests‚Äù) are mutated when editing a guest. Specifically, previous test cases assumed full tag overwriting behavior. However, the intended functionality is to allow users to incrementally add or remove tags without having to reset or overwrite the entire tag set.

‚∏ª

Problem Statement
	1.	Inconsistent test assumptions:
	‚Ä¢	Some tests were expecting edited guests to have their tags completely replaced, even when only one new tag was added.
	2.	Lack of incremental tag mutation:
	‚Ä¢	The CLI currently supports +req/ and -req/ syntax to add or remove individual tags.
	‚Ä¢	However, older tests and parts of the logic assume tags are wholesale replaced on edit, which is not in line with this incremental approach.

‚∏ª

Impact
	‚Ä¢	Developers and users face confusion when editing guests as tags may not persist as expected.
	‚Ä¢	Test cases fail due to mismatches between the old assumption (replace all tags) and the correct behavior (mutate tags incrementally).
	‚Ä¢	It makes it difficult to extend tag-editing capabilities (e.g., batch add/remove) since the current implementation does not clearly separate ‚Äúoverwrite‚Äù vs. ‚Äúmutate‚Äù operations.

‚∏ª

Proposed Solution
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that EditCommand appends or removes tags incrementally while preserving existing tags unless explicitly cleared.
	‚Ä¢	Update all relevant tests (e.g., EditCommandTest.java) to match this behavior.
	‚Ä¢	Review CLI parser (EditCommandParser) to enforce clear handling for:
	‚Ä¢	+req/ (add one or more tags)
	‚Ä¢	-req/ (remove one or more tags)
	‚Ä¢	t/ (optional: fully reset tags, if needed, in a future enhancement)
	‚Ä¢	Improve documentation for developers and users on how tag mutations work.

Summary:
	‚Ä¢	Added a TypicalRequests utility class to provide common Request instances (EXTRA_TOWELS and LATE_CHECKOUT) for use in tests.
	‚Ä¢	Wrote comprehensive unit tests for UniqueRequestList in UniqueRequestListTest.java.

Details:
	‚Ä¢	Covered all major functionalities of UniqueRequestList: contains(), add(), setRequest(), remove(), and setRequests().
	‚Ä¢	Verified behavior for normal operations, edge cases (e.g., null inputs), and exception-throwing scenarios (DuplicateRequestException, RequestNotFoundException, NullPointerException).
	‚Ä¢	Ensured immutability by testing asUnmodifiableObservableList().
	‚Ä¢	Confirmed consistency of toString() output with internal list state.

Notes:
	‚Ä¢	The tests are aligned with current project coding and testing conventions.
	‚Ä¢	This PR strengthens test coverage and ensures UniqueRequestList is robust against invalid operations.

This bug was reviewed in 1.5 and determined no longer relevant. 

In response to the following:
```
If this is a feature, it implicitly enforces that every room has a unique guest. However, it does not enforce all guest entries to be unique, allowing for duplicate guest entries. Note: technically the original AB3 enforces unique guest by enforcing unique names, however our guest book stops enforcing this if guest ID is used instead.
```

We now enforce guest uniqueness by email, thus we ensure each guest can only book one room, and each room has at least one guest.

# Bug Report for Untag Command

## Bug 1: Errors in User Guide Documentation
**Issues Found:**
- Untag command is given as `tag` in the description
- `At least one of the optional fields must be provided.` Perhaps you could elaborate more on this sentence on what is meant by optional fields
- `Existing values will be updated to the input values` Perhaps you could give an example for this.
- `When editing tags, the existing tags of the patient will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.` - Perhaps, you could clarify this or move this point to the edit section

### Screenshot from user guide:

<img width="817" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b38a032d-1f4b-4104-a028-e253f9385581" />

## Bug 2: Incorrect Error Handling when no Tag Parameters Provided

**Description:** 
`untag 2` command input reports success even when no tag parameters are provided

When executing the untag command without specifying any tag parameters (e.g., untag 2), CareConnect **incorrectly** reports success :`Tags successfully removed from Bernice Yu`, even though no tags were removed. 

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application
2. Ensure there are at least 2 patients in the list
3. Execute the command: untag 2 (without any tag parameters)
4. Observe the output message

**Expected Behaviour:**
The system should reject the command and display an error message indicating that at least one tag parameter must be provided, such as "Invalid command format! Please provide at least one tag to remove."

**Actual Behavior:**
The system accepts the command and displays: "Tags successfully removed from Bernice Yu" even though no tags were specified for removal.

**Documentation Reference:**
According to the command documentation: "At least one of the optional fields must be provided."
The correct format is `untag INDEX [t/TAG]...` where at least one tag must be specified.
Only `t/` without any tags is a valid special case to remove all tags.

**Severity:**
Medium - The system fails to provide appropriate feedback for an invalid command, which could confuse users about whether their command was processed.

**Suggested Fix:**
Modify the command parser to validate that either:
- At least one tag parameter is provided (e.g., untag 2 t/diabetes), or
- The special case syntax for removing all tags is used (e.g., untag 2 t/)

If neither condition is met, the system should display an appropriate error message.

**Screenshot:**
<img width="737" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3d0fe19-69be-416f-9fbf-6316204ff231" />

## Bug 3: `untag 2 t/` Command (Remove All Tags) Not Functional 
**Description:**
When executing the command `untag 2 t/`, which according to the documentation should remove all tags from the patient at index 2, nothing happens. The system doesn't produce any visible change, error message, or confirmation, despite this being explicitly documented as a valid command to "remove all the patient's tags."

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application
2. Ensure there are at least 2 patients in the list and the patient at index 2 has at least one tag
3. Execute the command: `untag 2 t/`
4. Observe that no response is given by the system and the tags remain unchanged

**Expected Behavior:**
According to the documentation: "You can remove all the patient's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it." The system should:
- Remove all tags from the patient at index 2
- Provide confirmation of the action with a success message

**Actual Behavior:**
The command appears to be ignored. No tags are removed from the patient, and the system doesn't provide any error message, warning, or confirmation of any action.

**Documentation Reference:**
The documentation explicitly states:
- "You can remove all the patient's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it."
- This is presented as a special case for the `untag` command that should be valid.

**Severity:**
High - A documented feature is completely non-functional, which could significantly impact users who need to remove all tags from a patient.

**Suggested Fix:**
Implement the special case handling for the `untag INDEX t/` command to properly remove all tags from the specified patient, as documented in the user guide.

**Screenshot:**
<img width="736" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eebfc449-78de-43a8-93f0-4cce00952315" />

## Bug 4: `untag` Command returns Success for Removing Non-existent Tags
**Description:**
The `untag` command incorrectly displays a success message when attempting to remove tags that don't exist on a patient. This gives users false feedback that something has changed when in fact no changes were made to the patient's tags.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application
2. Identify a patient (e.g., Bernice Yu at index 2) who does not have a specific tag (e.g., "boss")
3. Execute the command: `untag 2 t/boss`
4. Observe that the system reports "Tags [boss] successfully removed from Bernice Yu" despite no actual changes being made

**Expected Behavior:**
The system should either:
- Inform the user that the specified tag(s) don't exist on the patient
- Only report success if actual changes were made to the patient's tags

**Actual Behavior:**
The system displays a success message "Tags [boss] successfully removed from Bernice Yu" even when attempting to remove tags that don't exist on the patient.

**Severity:**
Medium - This issue provides misleading feedback to users but doesn't cause data loss or prevent functionality.

**Suggested Fix:**
Modify the `untag` command implementation to:
1. Check if the specified tags exist on the patient before attempting removal
2. Only display success messages when actual changes are made
3. Provide appropriate feedback when attempting to remove non-existent tags, such as "Tag [boss] not found on Bernice Yu"

**Screenshot:**

# Bug Report: `help` Command Ignores Extra Parameters

**Main Issue:**
`help` command processes invalid input with extra parameters

**Description:**
The `help` command incorrectly accepts and processes commands with additional parameters (e.g., `help me`). According to the documentation, the help command should only be used in the format `help` without any additional parameters.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application
2. Execute the command: `help me` (with an additional parameter)
3. Observe that the system still shows the help message as if the command was valid

**Expected Behaviour:**
The system should reject the command and display an error message indicating that the help command doesn't accept additional parameters, such as "Invalid command format! The help command doesn't take any parameters."

**Actual Behavior:**
The system accepts the command `help me` and displays the help message as if a correct `help` command was entered.

**Documentation Reference:**
According to the command documentation:
* The correct format is simply `help` with no additional parameters
* The documentation doesn't indicate that the command should accept additional text

**Severity:**
Low - The command still achieves its primary function of showing help information, but it accepts invalid syntax which could confuse users about proper command format requirements.

**Suggested Fix:**
Modify the command parser to strictly validate the help command format and reject any help commands with additional parameters. The system should display an appropriate error message when extra parameters are provided and also provide guidance to the user on the correct `help` command format.

**Additional Notes:**
While this bug doesn't prevent users from accessing help information, it creates inconsistency in how command validation is handled throughout the application. Other commands likely enforce their parameter requirements strictly, so the help command should maintain the same level of validation.

**Screenshot:**

# Bug Report: `list` Command Ignores Extra Parameters

**Main Issue:**
`list` command processes invalid input with extra parameters

**Description:**
The `list` command incorrectly accepts and processes commands with additional parameters (e.g., `list patients`). Similar to the `help` command issue, this command appears to ignore parameter validation according to its documented format.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application
2. Execute the command: `list patients` or any other variation with additional parameters
3. Observe that the system still shows the patient list as if the command was valid

**Expected Behaviour:**
The system should reject the command and display an error message indicating that the list command doesn't accept additional parameters, such as "Invalid command format! The list command doesn't take any parameters."

**Actual Behavior:**
The system accepts the command with extra parameters and displays the list of patients as if a correct `list` command was entered.

**Documentation Reference:**
According to the command documentation:
* The correct format is simply `list` with no additional parameters
* The documentation doesn't indicate that the command should accept additional text

**Severity:**
Low - The command still achieves its primary function of showing the patient list, but it accepts invalid syntax which could confuse users about proper command format requirements.

**Suggested Fix:**
Modify the command parser to strictly validate the list command format and reject any list commands with additional parameters. The system should display an appropriate error message when extra parameters are provided and also provide guidance to the user on the correct `list` command format.

**Additional Notes:**
This bug represents a pattern of inconsistent parameter validation across simple commands in the application. The system should maintain consistent syntax validation across all commands to provide clear feedback to users about what constitutes valid input.

# Bug Report for Edit Command

## Bug 1: Insufficient Phone Number Validation in `edit` Command
**Main Issue:**
`edit` command accepts invalid phone numbers for Singapore context

**Description:**
The `edit` command incorrectly accepts phone numbers that don't conform to Singapore's standard 8-digit format. Currently, the application only validates that phone numbers are at least 3 digits, which allows users to input invalid phone numbers that wouldn't be usable in a Singapore healthcare context.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application
2. Execute a command like: `edit 1 p/123456` (a 6-digit number)
3. Observe that the system accepts this invalid phone number format
4. Similarly, the system also accepts longer numbers like `p/12345678901`

**Expected Behavior:**
For a Singapore-based patient management system, the phone number validation should:
- Only accept 8-digit phone numbers (Singapore's standard format)
- Possibly only accept numbers starting with valid Singapore prefixes (8 or 9 for mobile, 6 for landline)
- Reject numbers that don't conform to these standards with a clear error message

**Actual Behavior:**
The system accepts any phone number that is at least 3 digits, regardless of whether it conforms to Singapore's phone number format. This allows invalid data to be stored in the system.

**Documentation Reference:**
While the documentation doesn't explicitly state the validation requirements for phone numbers, a healthcare application for Singapore users should enforce locally valid phone number formats.

**Severity:**
Medium - This issue allows invalid data to be stored in the system, which could lead to communication problems when attempting to contact patients.

**Suggested Fix:**
Modify the phone number validation to:
1. Strictly enforce 8-digit phone numbers
2. Optionally validate that mobile numbers start with 8 or 9, and landlines with 6
3. Provide clear error messages that explain the required format
4. Provide documentation on phone number requirements in user guide 

**Additional Notes:**
Proper validation is particularly important in healthcare applications where reaching patients reliably is crucial. Storing invalid phone numbers could lead to missed appointments or inability to contact patients in emergencies.

## Bug 2: Incomplete Documentation for Tag Editing Behavior

**Main Issue:**
User guide lacks clear explanation of tag editing behavior with `edit` command

**Description:**
The user guide's documentation for the `edit` command lacks important information about how tag editing works. While it mentions that "adding of tags is not cumulative," it fails to explicitly document two critical behaviors:
1. Using `edit INDEX t/` (with empty tag value) deletes all tags
2. Using `edit INDEX t/tag1 t/tag2 t/tag3` completely replaces existing tags with the new set

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Review the user guide documentation for the `edit` command
2. Note that while it mentions tags are "not cumulative," it doesn't provide explicit examples of these important tag editing behaviors

**Expected Behavior:**
The documentation should clearly explain all aspects of tag editing, including:
- Explicit statement that `edit INDEX t/` removes all tags
- Clear examples showing how multiple tags replace existing tags
- Explanation that each tag editing operation completely overwrites previous tags

**Actual Behavior:**
The documentation only vaguely states that "adding of tags is not cumulative" without providing clear examples or explanations of the complete tag editing functionality.

**Documentation Reference:**
Current documentation states:
* "When editing tags, the existing tags of the patient will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative."
* It provides an example: `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` but doesn't explicitly state this removes all tags.

**Severity:**
Medium - Missing documentation could lead to user confusion and unintentional data loss when editing tags.

**Suggested Fix:**
Update the documentation to clearly explain all tag editing behaviors:
1. Add an explicit statement: "Using `edit INDEX t/` removes all tags from the patient."
2. Add explanation: "When using multiple tags like `edit INDEX t/tag1 t/tag2`, all existing tags are replaced with the new set."
3. Include more comprehensive examples showing different tag editing scenarios.

**Additional Notes:**
Clear documentation is especially important for features that can result in data removal. Users need to fully understand how tag editing works to avoid accidentally removing important patient information.

The application not updating with time changes is expected due to its asynchronous nature. A regular user who opens and closes the application regularly should not normally encounter this visual bug.

The point of concern is that list does not re-render existing list items. This behavior is not isolated to this visual functionality of the colors of personcard and realistically affects any command that would cause the update and visual change of a personcard.

We can potentially add a method in multimap to check if a prefix is present. This will allow us to differentiate between fields that are not provided by user and fields where the prefix is provided but the field is actually empty. (currently both cases rely on getValue() which returns an empty string in which prevents proper distinguishing)

the logic seems to be that if we delete a wedding with the wedding list having only one wedding, we add a default wedding and set it to current wedding, meaning that the uniqueweddinglist size is never equals to one because there is always one wedding? seems like a wrong functionality

i think we should leave this check inside model. Model should throw a NoCurrentWeddingException (similar to how in the later try block, we catch the PersonNotFoundException) , which commandResult catches and throws a Command Exception, this will consolidate the code and separate the concerns better.Model: Does the checking of wedding being present, person being there, table being there etc. CommandResult: Handles whether I can execute the function.

Similar to the addpersonToTable, you can see how this makes the command extremely long with it checking if theres a current wedding while it catches errors related to person not found etc.

thanks for the comment yudong! that is because currently i don't see a need for a setter to change this as it is meant to be only called by the constructor. But in the future when there is a need i will definitely add it in.

For now this milestone is to test the code logic. Subsequent milestone will be done such that it is not hardcoded but i dont think evaluate based on year is feasible cause e.g. Year 2 Sem 2 -&gt; Year 3 Sem 1 will be same year. I will continue to think of better way to compare in subsequent milestone

Will edit part 1, part 2 (max 15 based on international standard), part 4 (only alphabet), part 6,
part 5 is quite complicated as there could be different address type for different standards and different language so having a strict regex may not be suitable
part 3 can discuss

The first error message is correct since negative values is a command format error (as shown by the description that index should be a positive integer). If i change this, then I would have to change the index class also. Should I just use the invalid command format message for index > list size?

Thats an interesting point. Do you mean when we are filtering to view details of each wedding? If we were to display all the tasks when calling for the wedding, I feel like there will be too much information. Thats why I decided to input a specific command for the user to view the task list as and when the user needs. Additionally , this would not appear as blocks but instead in the message output box only! We could discuss this in the next group meeting

I think this is the simplest way to go about doing this especially because it is CLI, because currently the weddingTasks are attached to each wedding. There wouldn't be a way to access the weddingTask associated without including the weddingId in the CLI. So a typical workflow would be like this, the user uses the ListCommand to view the list and then proceeds to Mark or Unmark the respective tasks based on the index as the List would be in the message output box, until he proceeds with a next command.

i actually think it would be helpful to say we would only have one instance of a wedding at any one point in time.  IF we want to change the wedding status to something else, we would have to delete the current wedding, create a new wedding object and then set it?

I see the issue‚Äîright now, users have to run setWedding after createWedding before they can access weddingOverview, which isn't ideal.

To fix this, we can ensure that the wedding instance is persistent across sessions so that once a wedding is created, it‚Äôs automatically set and accessible for weddingOverview. This way, users won‚Äôt need to manually run setWedding.

I‚Äôll look into implementing this change and update here once there‚Äôs progress. Let me know if you have any additional thoughts on how we should handle this!

I think the execution of a command includes the following steps:

1. `LogicManager` takes the `arg` String and calls `execute(arg)`

2. `parseCommand` method in `AddressBookParser` is called in `execute` method
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70817637-25ec-4658-8c5a-20539d97a874)
3. `parse` method in `SearchEventMemberCommandParser` is called
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ce8e59-f551-4246-9ca7-f27fd498f6c4)

So it is fine to leave it as `parseCommand`

Hmmm I don't think the previous one make sense, since the change i make is instead of counting entries from the entire address book, I now count entries from the filtered view. Since the warning is talkng about "Only persons up to index i have numerical value", it makes mores sense to return index that is displayed, which corresponds to counting on the filtered view

Not sure who wrote the line 49-51 (Maybe the previous authors of AB3) but I do remember fixing the checkstyle for the ```parse_emptyArg_throwsParseException()``` method. It seems like maybe an alternative is that the ```assertParseFailure()``` call should be its own test case or handled by separate assertions.

I see! So we are integrating an **archive** feature into the **save**  feature instead of sticking with plain file saving? I can make that work easily :D However, how are we going to deal with the number of stagnant files?

Our application does not include any server/database integration (online attack surface), and we did not import/utilize libraries that is/are required for offline attack surface. Therefore, we are relatively safe against known Jackson-Databind vulnerabilities such as: `CVE-2017-15095, CVE-2018-12022, CVE-2019-12384`. Hence, I will close this issue on that note.

@nicholasdaijh 
I like the detailed field explanations but maybe we could put the parameter rules in a glossary section and reference them in the commands, rather than repeating the same words across all commands.

This makes it easier to read through (for cs2101 ca3) and easier to update since its consolidated in one section.

What do you think?

I think reiterating key parameter info could indeed be beneficial to users. However, I find that the current format feels very cluttered because of the long, detailed sentences, which makes the guide harder to skim through.

For example,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8b05b81-3db8-4e70-80ff-697e19430714)

If you really insist on repeating the information, it **needs better formatting** (like bullet points, bold, italics). That said, I still believe that having a glossary for the parameters would help a lot. 

I understand that you are trying to stop people from finding fault with our code, but I think as long as we have clearly documented what the rules are in user guide somewhere, we can simply refer back to that if someone raises an issue (even if it is not repeated in every command).

Can consider standardizing it with other commands by writing it as "Parameters:" instead of "Usage": and the word "sort" is probably not required anymore since it is the COMMAND_WORD.

Consider trimming each parameter as well since if you consider the case of "sort name     desc" where there are multiple whitespaces between [ATTRIBUTE] and [DIRECTION], the command would no longer work

Looks like you have changed the NRIC class to allow make NRIC string to be case-insensitive, which leads to this cascading effect. I have changed my AttendanceCommand class accordingly and now it should be fixed!

Yep, I agree that it might indeed be abit lengthy for the readers to read. I think its something that we can deal with during v1.6 but for now we can probably just stick to this first since we are closing v1.5. Thanks for the feedback!

hmm, you are right, but right now, how they parse the user input in addressbookparser is they split the command and arguments by the first whitespace, so after parsing, String commandWord in addressbookparser would still be "create" instead of "create -s". Then this might be a problem because if i change COMMAND_WORD to "create -s", the parser would not be able to find any user input with the command matching to "create -s". So, should we modify the regex implementation?

Two people may share a phone number, i.e. if it's a family or office contact number.

It's possible to enforce it, however, I believe the situation under which two emails are attached to the same person is hardly achievable, unless the user is deliberately trying to get it. And if they do, they probably have a strong reason for that.

Yes, but I think for simplicity, it's easiest to disable editting NRIC because we do not have much time. If we allow editting, we must also edit other NRIC fields in the other lists to match the data, which is possible but I don't think we can make it before 10am

LGTM! I like how you made the command usage consistent and improved whitespace handling.
The trimming logic make the parser more user-friendly and resilient. 

Just a minor note: maybe consider ensuring these changes are reflected in test cases and documentation (especially if the identifier prefix trimming affects user input expectations).

I like how you included this feature as a CLI since we didn't have one for selecting a household, but maybe a shorter command word would better optimise the user experience/convenience? For example, "view" or "view-h" could perhaps work since it's shorter.

Now, some parsing is duplicated between MainWindow and ViewHouseholdSessionsCommandParser:
Both are parsing out the "id/" prefix and extracting the ID.

Perhaps this can be extracted into a shared utility method, e.g., ParserUtil.parseHouseholdId(String arg) so both the command and the UI logic rely on the same behavior?

Nice job covering unstructured input! It's good to ensure that completely invalid formats are explicitly rejected. This helps catch command misuse early and keeps the parser resilient.

LGTM! But you may consider adding tests for scenarios such as:

I think that a plain arrow showing association should be used instead of a filled diamond for composition as Status is an enum and does not depend on any Booking to exist. Booking references one Status.

Nice work on covering the core functionality of MarkCommand! Perhaps you could consider adding a test case where the booking is already in the target status (e.g., marking an already COMPLETED booking as COMPLETED again), to verify that repeated status updates behave as expected.

It works fine when just adding reservations (changes colour when 3 reservations are made by the same person). However if I try to edit the regular's phone number, it still remains highlighted. 
E.g. John has phone number 1234 and makes 3 reservations, so he becomes a regular and his reservation card changes colour. However, when I edit one of those reservations to phone number 4321 instead, that reservation still remains highlighted and counter will be at 3, marking the person as a regular (even though there's only 1 reservation under the phone number 4321). 

Other 2 reservations with phone number 1234 are correctly not highlighted. However, if I add another reservation with phone number 1234, it does not get highlighted. Reservation counter is at 1 and it is not a regular even though the person made 3 reservations.

In the current implementation, the check is done in AddVisitCommand:execute() and addVisit does not throw CommandException. This is indeed more troublesome, but it is consistent with the original behaviour for add person; also, addVisit is also used by storage classes and they would have to catch CommandException if addVisit were to throw it. Great job for the diagram though!

I think now if we edit NRIC of a visit, it will change to being the visit of that person (or not allowed if the person with that NRIC does not exists). I will look into the problem with editing NRIC of a person though.

### Void Issue Explanation

The issue is void because the `assign` command **should allow assigning an existing duty date** to multiple personnel, even if one or more already have it.

#### Example Scenario

- Personnel 1 already has a duty on `2025-05-30`.
- User enters the following command:
- assign 1 2 3 d/2025-05-30


#### Expected Behavior

- The command should **execute successfully**.
- It should assign the duty on `2025-05-30` to Personnel 1, 2, and 3.
- No error should be thrown, even if some already have the duty date assigned.

#### Justification

- Re-assigning an existing duty should be **idempotent** and **non-blocking**.
- This ensures a smoother user experience when batch-assigning duties.

Sure! Here's a cleaned-up version of your markdown message:

### Void Issue Explanation

The issue is void because the `filter` command **should allow different battalions to assign their own company names**, because different services and respective battalions have their own style for naming (e.g. ALPHA, SCC, etc.)

#### üìù Justification

- Filter should allow HR to name the companies freely, **in accordance to alphanumerical characters and other constraints**, to ensure a smoother user experience when onboarding new personnel

Lines 49, 53, 58 and 60 use VALID_MODTUT_FRIEND/VALID_MODTUT_HUSBAND or MODTUT_DESC_FRIEND/MODTUT_DESC_HUSBAND.
I think we should use VALID_MODTUT_BOB, VALID_MODTUT_AMY and MODTUT_DESC_AMY, MODTUT_DESC_BOB instead as the naming makes more sense than husband and friend when concerning modtutgroups

It seems you're using person.getModTutGroups().iterator().next().getModule().getName() or person.getModTutGroups().iterator().next().getTutorial().getName() a lot for updating the view tabs after a command. 

You could try extracting out the command to something like getFirstModuleName() and getFirstModuleTutorialName() under Person and shortening ModTutGroup.getModule().getName() to just ModtutGroup.getModuleName() etc.

Find command cannot search by module tutorial group keywords. It only allows for name, tele or email. I think it's a bit redundant to add finding by module-tut since the view tabs and view command already do that.

**12 :octicon-comment:** %%(other comment)%%

In UI I can force each tag to abbreviate with ellipsis if there are more than 75 characters. This way, `X info &lt;idx>` can still display the tag in whole in ResultDIsplay. Since we only need to adhere to the 1280x720 requirement, I think this is an ok fix

Maybe you can specify that the sorting is alphabetical, for additional clarity. If not might be unclear; user might think it is chronological sorting.

hi James, I just noticed this for both of our add-tags and remove-tags but under features the [t/TAG] square brackets are used to show that the field is optional. Since these commands require at least one tag to be specified, should we change the formatting to 

add-tags INDEX t/TAG [t/MORE_TAGS]...

Let me know what you think and I'll update my parts accordingly as well

Yes, the original method works well for case-insensitivity :) The change was made to address the bug pointed out by @delonlee01 where the message would show the version of the tag that the user input (e.g. FriEnDs) as "already in the person's list" instead of the version that is actually in the list (if the person's existing tag is "Friends") 

This is why I used a stream to return a Tag object from the list of the persons tags, so that I can get the existingTag which is from the list and add it into the duplicateTags set rather than the tag that was input.

Do let me know if you have any suggestions on how to better implement this! Thanks James

# Feature: Show the commissions received from each downline over their lifetime in a list

## Purpose
Enables users to quickly view the total commissions earned from each downline recorded in the AddressBook. This helps identify the most valuable downlines at a glance, aiding in financial tracking or reporting. Only contacts labelled downlines can have commissions.

---

## Command Format

lc [optional flags]
- **Short command:** `lc`
- **Optional Sorting Flag:**  
  - `/sort <direction>` where `<direction>` is either `asc` or `desc`  
  - Example usage: `lc /sort asc` or `lc /sort desc`

If no sorting flag is provided, the application may display the results in a default order (e.g., alphabetical by name, or by most recently updated).

---

## Example Commands

1. **Basic (no sorting)**  
lc
- Displays the list of each downline and their lifetime commissions in the default order.

2. **Sorted (ascending)**  
lc /sort asc
- Displays the list sorted by total commissions in ascending order (lowest commission first).

3. **Sorted (descending)**  
lc /sort desc
- Displays the list sorted by total commissions in descending order (highest commission first).

---

## Parameters & Validation Rules

### **No Mandatory Parameters**
- By default, `lc` requires no parameters.

### **Optional Sorting Parameter**
- **Syntax:** `/sort <direction>`
- **Acceptable Values:**  
- `"asc"` or `"desc"` (case-insensitive, e.g., `ASC` or `Asc` is valid).
- **Invalid if:**  
- Any other value is provided (e.g., `/sort random`).
- **Error Message (on invalid sort direction):**  
"Invalid sort direction. Use '/sort asc' or '/sort desc'."
---

## Outputs

### On Success
- **Command:** `lc [optional sorting flag]`
- **Behavior:**  
1. **Lists each downline** in the AddressBook.  
2. **Shows their lifetime commissions** (the total amount received from each contact).  
3. **Applies sorting** if `/sort asc` or `/sort desc` is specified.

- **Example Successful Output:**
Here is the total commission for each downline:
1. John Doe - $12,000
2. Jane Smith - $9,250
3. Mike Johnson - $2,500

### On Failure
1. **No Downline Found**
"No Downline in the address book."
2. **Invalid Sorting Flag**
"Invalid sort direction. Use '/sort asc' or '/sort desc'."
---

## Possible Errors & Edge Cases
1. **No Commission Records**
- **Description:** Contacts exist, but none have a commission value.
- **Response:** Display `$0.00` or `N/A` for each contact instead of showing an error.

2. **Unrecognized Command Input**
- **Example:** `lc somethingExtra`
- **Response:**  
  ```
  "Unrecognized parameter 'somethingExtra'. Type 'help lc' for usage."
  ```

I just used the `LocalDateTime` comparison function that is provided so I think it's fine.

Can consider using the term "subcommand". Lots of CLI parsers use this to describe precisely what we're trying to do here. [eg-1][eg-1], [eg-2][eg-2], [eg-3][eg-3]

Also, it seems like a code formatter was used. Consider formatting the code in one commit, and then editing the text in another. That way, GitHub can help isolate the edits commit-to-commit when viewing the diff.

Can consider inheriting `ArgumentMultimap`'s behavior.

By putting a prefix in front of the tutorial name, the `ArgumentMultimap` will just trim everything between the prefix and the tutorial name.

I named it deleteall with extendability in mind (i.e. deleteall persons with a specific role) which is why I named it DeleteAllCommand. I do see why this wouldn't be too intuitive for the current state however. I will look into renaming it into DeleteAllWithTagCommand for now (and vice versa) but KIV the potential extensions. Thanks.

As parry mentioned, there should've been some kind of validation mechanism in order to check for invalid names, phones, etc. I didn't implement any test cases during the initial merge so this went over my head! Hopefully adding checks as well as adding some more test cases fixed the issue.

OH okay so _this time_ it failed because of the compile error with AddCommand and EditCommand classes. Ig whoever is working on that can change them in this PR? Or maybe everyone can work in this PR? Or do we not have to pass these checks to merge, idk.
