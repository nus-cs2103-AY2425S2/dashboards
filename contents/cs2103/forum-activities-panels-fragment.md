**2. :fas-info-circle: Event Driven vs Transaction Processing**
</div>

Hi!

I noticed that the event-driven architectural style and the transaction processing architectural look really similar, and I don't see much of a difference between the concept of an "event" and a "transaction". What are the differences between the two, if any?

The relevant lecture notes can be found [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week11/topics.html#w11-2-architectural-styles) for reference.

Thanks!

I think there's a typo here where it should say "start and end" instead

**5. :fas-info-circle: Severity of Incorrect But Not Too Important Information**
</div>

Hi! 

This was one of the bugs I reported during the PE earlier today, where the user guide said that interviews in the past would be in a lighter shade, but it appears darker in the dark theme. (I forgot to check if the light theme had the same issue in the middle of the PE.)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56744bb3-035a-410f-bf77-ff6adfb1192f)

Would this count as `severity.Low` or `severity.Medium`? On one hand, it is incorrect information (argument for medium). On the other hand, it does not affect the user too much (argument for low). I've currently put it as `Low`, but a friend said that they would probably put it as `Medium`.

Thanks!

Hi!

Assuming I didn't misremember, testers are allowed to modify the bug type and severity as well as pick 6 bugs for about half a day after the duration of the PE.

Will this be done by just editing the bug type/severity in catcher and deleting the issues that we don't select?

**11. :fas-info-circle: Some Students Might Not Know What LumiNUS Is**
</div>

Hi! 

This is a question from the week 11 quiz

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93c7933e-2282-4621-9a30-ffe5e352983d)

However, LumiNUS was discontinued and fully replaced by Canvas starting around AY22/23 Sem 2 (I know this since I'm currently a y4). Most people taking CS2103T are y2, so they might not know what LumiNUS is. Maybe the question could be updated in future iterations to elaborate on what LumiNUS is or use Canvas instead?

Rest in peace LumiNUS, you will be missed

**12. :fas-info-circle: GitHub Autogenerated PR Commit Msges Were Too Long**
</div>

Hi!

I just had the sudden realization that sometimes, the auto generated commit message when merging a PR on GitHub will sometimes exceed 72 characters if the branch name is too long

One example is the following commit message from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/commit/0a2983dbba7ef7f46aeebcb0de96764cd249d81c)
'''
Merge pull request #91 from Bryce-3D/2025-03-24_fix-dellastvisitcommand.java-codestyle
'''
which has a length of 86 characters.

Will there be deductions for commit messages that are too long from merged PRs?

Is there any way to fix this to edit the commit message to comply with the standard? Would we have to manually hand edit the commits somehow to become compliant? Would this make every previous submission count as late? How can this issue be fixed?

Is this guaranteed minus marks for whoever merged in the PRs? Or is there some way to prevent the loss of marks?

Thanks!

Hi!

This is kinda minor, but in the first video of [Week 9 Topics](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week9/topics.html), the question immediately pops up at 9:13 before the video says the "here is the question, you can pause" line.

It was fine for me though since this isn't a question where you're shown diagrams and the question text only says a,b,c without the diagram.

Since all function calls are synchronous for the purposes of this module, would it be fine to draw all arrowheads as the lined one for convenience? The filled one would take more time to draw due to the extra shading needed.

**19. :fas-info-circle: Double Check How to do Week 6 tP Task 4 Tutorial 2**
</div>

Hi!

I'm currently doing the [add `RemarkCommand` tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html) as instructed in [Week 6 tP Task 4 Tutorial 2](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week6/project.html#4-get-familiar-with-the-codebase).

I'm currently trying to add the test in the [Hook `RemarkCommand` into the application](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html#hook-remarkcommand-into-the-application)

However, the provided code snippet below had the variable `MESSAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET`, which I could not find elsewhere in the code using the Search Everywhere function in IntelliJ

'''java
    @Test
    public void execute() ``{``
        assertCommandFailure(new RemarkCommand(), model, MESSAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET);
    ``}``
'''

I decided to look through the other `*CommandTest.java` files and tried to find a way to get it to work similarly. After some trial and error, I ended up with the screenshot below which finally made the test pass.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae72e8e0-d80a-46dc-90aa-c044b3fba634)

Is this the intended way to do this? Or is it supposed to be done differently? Any guidance would be appreciated.

Thanks!

`RemarkCommand.java`

'''java

I'm currently doing the [`tP` code tracing exercise](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3TracingCode.html) given at the bottom of the week 6 project page. One of the steps involves searching the codebase for the `execute()` function.

**23. :fas-info-circle: GitHub CI Actions Fails Sometimes For No Reason**

Hi!

I'm not sure why, but the CI Actions sometimes fails a run.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0191b3ad-e53f-493e-8cd9-48778c2c5db8)

In the screenshot above, the [2nd most recent CI Action](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/actions/runs/13648649492) was from a PR I merged. When I looked at the PR, I verified that it passed the CI Action. But the CI Action (originally) failed after the PR got merged in.

I tried looking up how to rerun a CI Action job, and found [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs#re-running-a-specific-job-in-a-workflow) on how to do this. I reran each of the 3 jobs in the CI Action individually and they all passed, leading to the screenshot above where they passed now.

Why does GitHub sometimes fail a CI Action run randomly? I think it also happened to me in my `iP` a few times after I did the optional `A-CI` increment.

Thanks!

&lt;!-- There is also [another PR](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/33) where the only things edited are the `README.md` and an image. However, it fails the CI Action runs too, as shown in the screenshot above. Currently, the PR looks like this

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1294bfb-9b31-4416-9037-a515f98c4430)

**24. :fas-info-circle: Upstream Somehow Automatically Fetched?**
</div>

Hi!

First off for context, I have [my team's tP repo](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp) as `upstream` and [my fork on GitHub](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/tp) as `origin`

I recently made [a PR](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/32), and a groupmate merged it in. I was going to fetch the update to `upstream` via CLI, got confused when my `git fetch upstream` kept giving no response, indicating that there was nothing to fetch.

I decided to check my history graph on SourceTree, and it seems that it somehow was already fetched as shown in the screenshot below since `upstream/master` is visible there.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d9b17a4-ee87-4a06-9709-9b10a0266cbe)

I had both Git Bash and SourceTree open the whole time, but am pretty sure that I didn't fetch it yet. I left my laptop open for a while, came back, saw that my PR got merged, and went to Git Bash where I encountered this weird scenario. I also double checked, and the time the PR got merged was after I left my laptop, so it should not have been fetched yet.

The previous command on my Git Bash was me pushing the changes for the PR too.

Is Git Bash/SourceTree somehow able to automatically fetch updates to `upstream`? 

Thanks!

**25. :fas-info-circle: Master Branch No Longer On The Main Line**
</div>

Hi!

I was trying to update my own main branch to match the main branch of my team's tP repo after merging in some PRs as instructed in the forking workflow. 

However, I double checking the current structure of my git history by opening SourceTree, and it looks like my local master branch has somehow gone off the "main branch" of the blue line on the left.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5326008-1ad3-4ed0-9863-8e9018b970bb)

Is this normal, or does it mean I'm moving my main branch wrongly somewhere?

Thanks!

**26. :fas-info-circle: Is The Name `upstream` Important Here?**
</div>

Hi! I'm currently working on the workflow session with my teammates, and there's something I want to ask.

When I'm setting up the upstream(?) so that I can pull from the "master team repo" to my local laptop (since the forking workflow involved pulling from that "master team repo" then pushing it to my fork to update my own fork), one of the arguments here was `upstream`

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ccbaa9-caae-46eb-90a4-004918b34d8a)

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp.git
```

Does it have any significance, or is it just a name for it and I could've done something like 

```
git remote add main-team-repo https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp.git
```

if I wanted?

Thanks!

Hi!

In the tip at the start of the [Design section of the AB-3 Developer Guide](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#design), it currently says

Should it be something like

**28. :fas-info-circle: Grammar Issue in the Configuring IntelliJ Code Style Page?**

Hi!

I was reading the [IntelliJ Configuring Codestyle Page](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) linked from the [tP Setting Up Guide](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/tp/SettingUp.html) linked from the [tP Individual Fork Setup](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/appendixE-gitHub.html#tp-individual-fork-setup), and there seems to be some weird grammar in the first sentence.

I think that 

> IntelliJ’s default style is mostly compliant with [ours](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java) but it uses a different import order from ours but some tweaks may be needed.

should instead be something like

> IntelliJ’s default style is mostly compliant with [ours](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java) but it uses a different import order from ours and some (other) tweaks may be needed.

or

The 2 buts together sounds off to me.

Hi!

I'm currently in the process of cloning the tP to my computer after forking it to my team's github organization and forking that to my personal github account. I'm currently following the [Gradle Guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) linked in the 2nd step of [Setting Up Guide](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/tp/SettingUp.html) which was linked in the [tP Individual Fork Setup](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/appendixE-gitHub.html#tp-individual-fork-setup). 

It was mentioned that JDK and Gradle must use the same Java version. However, the defaults in my project currently have the JDK as Oracle OpenJDK 17.0.13 and Gradle as Project SDK 17 as shown in the screenshots below.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77d93a06-9bce-4c2f-bd2c-f770529f2def)

Which of the two should I be using, or is using either fine as long as the JDK and Gradle are consistent?

Hi! 

I was starting to do the tP setup for my team as instructed [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/appendixE-gitHub.html#tp-team-organization-setup) and am currently in the "Set up codecov" step, following the instructions in the [DevOps Guide](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/tp/DevOps.html) which further links to a [Codecov guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/codecov.html)

In Step 5, it says the following

However, I don't see any CI runs in the repo currently as shown in the screenshot below

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edf99dd6-eaf9-46ce-95ff-af5cce961fca)

I also don't think I can manually run the `gradle.yml` file since it does not have `workflow_dispatch:` under the `on:` section (such as [my iP](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/ip/blob/master/.github/workflows/gradle.yml) where I added that line).

Am I misunderstanding what "re-run the most recent CI run" means? Should I do a dummy commit like creating an empty text file to trigger the github actions, or add the `workflow_dispatch:` thing under `on:` in `gradle.yml` so that I can run it manually if I want to, something else entirely?

**33. :fas-info-circle: Bug of New Line Appearing Out Of Nowhere**
</div>

Hi!

I'm really confused by a weird bug in my code where it crashes when it tries to load a `Deadline` from my storage file `HomuraTodos.txt`. Currently the contents of `HomuraTodos.txt` are as follows (leftover from previous testing). The 1st part represents whether it is a `Todo`, `Deadline`, or `Event`, the 2nd part marks whether it is done or not, and the rest contains information about the `Todo`.

'''
t | 0 | something
d | 0 | CS2103T | 2025-02-28
e | 0 | Sem 8 | 2025-01-01 | 2025-04-30
t | 0 | you
d | 0 | you | 2010-01-01
e | 0 | you | 2000-01-01 | 3000-01-01
'''

When my program tries to load this, it results in the following error message, which seems to indicate that the code is incorrectly parsing line 2 of my storage file by mistakenly including the new line when parsing the date.

I don't understand where the new line could possibly be coming from. As you can see in the code above, I tried printing out the strings in `Storage,readTodos()`, and the new line is not there, as there is no extra blank line printed to the console. And none of the other functions even use `'\n'` in their code.

I was trying it out in my other repo [samplerepo-things](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/samplerepo-things) to figure out how it actually works. I currently have [this '.yml file](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/samplerepo-things/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml), which I don't think should do anything since everything is commented out. However, as shown in the screenshot below. Why does it always mark it as failed?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8299ae0-72aa-4b03-a0cf-186f3046d5ef)

I also have [another CI '.yml' file](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/samplerepo-things/blob/master/.github/workflows/blank.yml) here which was copied from [here](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/blank.yml) (found from the [GitHub quickstart tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart#using-workflow-templates))

However, it seems that it fails when GitHub automatically runs but passes when I run it manually? I'm really confused by this behavior.

I'm guessing that this likely means that the authentication method that I used did not give SourceTree workflow permissions, since it says [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week5/project.html#4-add-increment-a-ci) 
> Also note that pushing a GitHub Actions related file to GitHub requires you to authenticate using a PAT that has `workflow` permissions (because you are modifying a workflow of your repo). If you are using Sourcetree, you can refer to [Sourcetree Guide @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html) to learn how to connect Sourcetree with GitHub using a PAT.

So I tried going to the [SourceTree Guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html) linked there, but it's the same one from the start of the semester when we first set up SourceTree. I have already fully followed Option 2. I tried following Option 1 at first back then, but as elaborated in [this previous issue](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/1), it would not work for me.

How can I be able to commit the `.yml` file using SourceTree? Or is there some workaround I can use?

My OS is WIndows 11 in case this is relevant.

I'm currently trying to do the [A-CI](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week5/project.html#4-add-increment-a-ci) task for week 5. Following the links leads to this [sample .yml file](https://github.com/se-edu/duke/blob/full-template/.github/workflows/gradle.yml) used to automate the GitHub CI actions thing.

I tried asking ChatGPT to help explain to me what this .yml file is doing with the following prompt

'''
Hi! I'm trying to learn about doing continuous integration (CI) on GitHub 
and wish to use it for a chatbot in java. I was provided the following 
sample .yml file used for a similar project, but I don't really understand 
how it works. Could you help explain how this file works? 

' ' '
#A copy of the file
' ' '

Thanks!
'''

And in one part of its explanation, it gave the following remark about redundant code 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10145d01-820e-4f25-a79e-1e0f882a455d)

Is ChatGPT in the wrong here, or is there redundant code in the sample '.yml' file? I'm still trying to figure out how this file works right now so I don't know.

Thanks!

**38. :fas-info-circle: What to put in empty `catch` blocks?**
</div>

Hi!

I'm currently working on the [`A-CodeQuality`](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week5/project.html#3-add-increments-as-prs-a-assertions-a-codequality-a-streams) task of the iP. In the [week 5 notes](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week5/topics.html#unsafe-practices), it mentions avoiding empty catch blocks.

As of now, my code has the following empty catch blocks

`src/main/java/homura/Todo.java`
'''java
    /**
     * Writes the String to a file.
     * Creates a file if it does not exist and overwrites an
     * existing file, if any.
     *
     * @param txt The text to write.
     * @param fn The filename.
     */
    public static void writeFile(String txt, String fn) ``{``
        File f = new File(fn);
        try ``{``
            f.createNewFile();
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
        ``}``
        try ``{``
            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f);
            fw.write(txt);
            fw.close();
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
        ``}``
    ``}``
'''

`src/test/java/homura/TodoTest.java`
'''java
    // Invalid Inputs ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    @Test
    public void fromStorageStr_invalid_die() ``{``
        try ``{``
            Todo.fromStorageStr("chat what did they mean by this");
            fail();
        ``}`` catch (Exception e) ``{``
        ``}``
    ``}``
'''

However, in both of the above codes, I don't want my program to do anything in the catch block. I assume that this means that there might be something off about the way my code is structured. How do I go about fixing this? Especially for the 2nd one, where the only thing I'm trying to test for is that an error gets thrown.

Thanks!

**39. :fas-info-circle: Is `A-Streams` Required?**
</div>

Hi!

I just finished week 4 iP tasks earlier today, so I decided to start reading through the week 5 iP tasks. 

I noticed that the [3rd step](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week5/project.html#3-add-increments-as-prs-a-assertions-a-codequality-a-streams) involves creating 3 branches and merging them into main one by one via PRs on GitHub. However, one of these branches (`A-Streams`) is marked as optional.

I don't really see any part of my code where using a `Stream`, so I likely will not do that optional task. It also says "if applicable" in the instructions. But if I don't have any commits, how will I merge it in with a PR? Do I have to add in Streams somewhere? Make a dummy commit in `branch-A-Streams`? Or do something else?

Thanks!

**40. :fas-info-circle: 💡Fix SourceTree not Opening (Windows)**
</div>

Hi!

During the past week or two, SourceTree would occasionally seem to crash when I tried to open it, and I'd have to relaunch the app to get it to open. Just now, I tried opening it at least 5 times, and it refused to startup properly.

I found this [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36986079/source-tree-doesnt-launch-after-installation) to fix the issue. Specifically, the suggestion of the 3rd comment to
> Delete the `C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Local\Atlassian` folder

was the one that worked for me.

Although as a result SourceTree will forget what local repositories you'll have, and you'll need to locate them and reopen them.

However, this feels a bit hacky, I originally planned to have the first 3 functions all be named `toStr()` and let polymorphism handle things for me. However, it seemed to just parse everything as a `Todo` which confused me. Is there any way to make this cleaner, or is this really the way to do it?

Thanks!

Is the chatbot supposed to immediately exit upon an error (such as a wrong command inputted by the user shown in the `Level-5` sample usage), or is it supposed to still continue working afterwards?

If it's supposed to continue working afterwards and ignore the erroneous command, then does it make sense to throw an exception and catch it within the same function? It seems that most of the exceptions that can happen in my code would be within the `main()` function.

It compiles and runs fine on my IntelliJ. However, it results in the following error when I try to run it on either of 'runtest.sh' using Git Bash or runtest.bat' using the terminal (powershell?) inside IntelliJ
'''sh

Is there a way for me to use this character without the 'A-TextUiTesting' scripts breaking?

I've also checked, and the java version on both Git Bash and the IntelliJ terminal are both 'java 17.0.13 2024-10-15 LTS'.

Thanks!

**62. :fas-info-circle: How to Open Git Bash on Windows 11**
</div>

Hi! I'm trying to open git bash on my windows 11 laptop (part of the CLI instructions for [this section](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week2/topics.html#W2-4b) of the notes).

I tried looking up how to do this online, but the answers I saw mostly looked somewhat complicated or confused me. Is there a simple way to open git bash?

I know that I can open some sort of terminal by clicking the terminal button at the upper right corner of Sourcetree, but I'm not sure if this is git bash, and think that there should probably be a way to do it without opening Sourcetree.

Thanks!

Hi! 

Tutreg round 2 is currently ongoing until 17:00 today. I'm not sure why but I can select a CS2103T tutorial. It didn't appear during round 1.

Shouldn't this already be determined from the lecture slot picked during coursereg? Do I still have to select my tutorial? And does it have to match my lecture slot/CS2101 slot?

**64. :fas-info-circle: Sourcetree Authentication Not Working**

Hi! 

I'm trying to follow the instructions given [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html) (which was linked from [the course website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week1/admin.html) in the git section) to install Sourcetree. Specifically, I'm following the steps for option 1 on windows.

However, when I get to the authentication step, I keep getting the error in the screenshot below. I also kept getting the same error when I tried installing Sourcetree in late December (following the same instructions from the course website last sem) even after deleting Sourcetree following [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42541483/sourcetree-does-not-fully-uninstall) and following the instructions again.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5667f27e-d106-4b15-8e61-0471ba3c40fb)

Is there some way to get Sourcetree to accept the personal access token? My OS is Windows 11 Version 23H2 (OS Build 22631.4602).

Hi!

Sorry for not putting this, but searching for it in the start menu was among the first things I tried. It also seems to not appear under more options for me.

Is installing git bash a completely separate process from adding git into Sourcetree? I also thought that my laptop would've had it already since I've used github CLI for a personal project before (albeit only using `git add`, `git commit -m`, and `git push`)

Thanks!

Hi! Sorry for the late reply.

I tried following samuelneo's reply, and it appears in the start menu now, so the issue is resolved now.

I did install WSL a few months ago, but am not sure how to get WSL to access my Documents folder, so I very rarely use it. I haven't tried using WSL with IntelliJ, but it looks cool.

Accessing the git-bash terminal through the SourceTree UI worked, though I was wondering if it was possible to access it without opening SourceTree. Git commends also didn't seem to work on powershell when I tried them.

Thanks!

Hi! It was mentioned in `Level-2` that

So I'm assuming that it should restart from an empty list at each run and they just demonstrated the behavior of marking as done after already adding the items in for brevity.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

My current main function is about 100 lines of code, although it could probably be trimmed down to around 80 removing blank lines or a few comments. I'm not really sure how to modularize it further since currently it's just 

read input -&gt; if cmd is "bye", do stuff -&gt; if cmd is "list", do stuff -&gt; ... -&gt; if cmd is not a valid cmd, throw an exception

Do you have any advice on how this could be modularized? I have a `TODO`, `Deadline`, and `Event` class for the items in the list and have modularized out some print messages.

Thanks!

I see, I'll try doing that to modularize it a bit. Thanks!

Although in that case, I'm still not sure if using an exception would make sense (assuming that the program shouldn't just halt when you do something like `delete you`) since it can be handled within the function itself, making throwing an exception still redundant.

Is the program supposed to halt on invalid commands or continue running?

Are we allowed to have `public final` attributes in our class? Technically there is no risk of modifying the value (for primitive types at least) since it is final, but the [code style guide](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html) said to make all attributes private.

> Class variables should never be declared public unless the class is a data class with no behavior. This rule does not apply to constants.

Is it referring to [this part](https://youtu.be/6V6G3RyxEMk?t=1105) of the linked Gradle Youtube introduction video? It wasn't called "importing" there so I'm not sure.

I'm a bit scared to try it in case it bricks my project and I can't restore it back. I have the `.idea` folder still saved, but forgot to backup the entire iP folder.

Thanks Prof @damithc for that info. I found a work around using that by doing the following
- Rename local `branch-A-Javadoc` to `branch-A-JavaDoc2` then back to `branch-A-JavaDoc`
- Rename branch on GitHub from `branch-A-Javadoc` to `branch-A-JavaDoc2`
- Fetch all branches on SourceTree
- Delete `origin/branch-A-Javadoc` from SourceTree
- Rename branch on GitHub from `branch-A-JavaDoc2` to `branch-A-JavaDoc`
- Fetch all branches on SourceTree
- Delete `origin/branch-A-JavaDoc2` from SourceTree
- Set the local branch `branch-A-JavaDoc` to track `origin/branch-A-JavaDoc` instead of `origin/branch-A-Javadoc`

Hi!

I tried invalidating IntelliJ's cache, and it managed to run the tests of a single test file once. However, any future run resulted in an error. I tried invalidating the cache again and still got the same error even on the first try. I also tried invalidating the cache while ticking all 4 check marks, and it still fails on the first try.

The error I get looks like this

Hi! Trying [lavanyagarg112](https://github.com/lavanyagarg112)'s approach first. Running the command gives the same error.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b0fd25-1802-46a5-a119-7665f066d737)

I'm not sure if this is right, but according to this [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31885658/what-does-refresh-all-gradle-projects-do), this should be the "reload all gradle projects" button.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c306637-14d7-47c8-9132-872475c53d84)

I tried right clicking the run configurations and selected delete. They were still there at first but got removed after I clicked the "reload all gralde projects" button in the above screenshot.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6f6535b-eac9-48ee-a4e3-100139dc40f4)

It still got the same error in the end in the CLI. It also didn't work when right clicked and run within IntelliJ.

Trying [Gra7ityIC3](https://github.com/Gra7ityIC3)'s comment now. I renamed my module from `Homura` to `homura` a shortly after making this issue for the `A-CodingStandard` task in week 3, so that step should be done.

After running the 3 given commands, it seems to work on the CLI now

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f84ed2-aaee-4e62-a715-ed93a7a57e62)

So the fix was to run the commands

./gradlew clean

./gradlew test --tests "homura.TodoTest"

Hi!

It updates 2 to 3 times a day from what I've seen. If your tag is not being picked up, it/s likely due to it not being pushed from sourcetree to github or a typo.

There is a typo in this case, you typed `A-Varags` instead of `A-Varargs`. This can be fixed by renaming the tag in SourceTree and pushing all tags again.

Hi!

I mentioned above that I used option 2 rather than option 1, so I didn't use the PAT. I used the other login method listed under option 2 [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html), and as mentioned in my previous issue, option 1 would not work.

Hi! I had a slightly different approach to this. I would request my user to send any message after bye to close the application with this code [here](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/ip/blob/master/src/main/java/homura/MainWindow.java)

     * the dialog container. Clears the user input after processing.

    @FXML
    private void handleUserInput() ``{``
        // Logic to not instantly exit when turning off (1/2)
        if (isOffing) ``{``
            // Inspired by asking ChatGPT the following query
            // "Hi! I'm now trying to make my application exit upon receiving
            // the command "bye". However, I'm not sure how to do this. I
            // currently have this handler to handle the user's inputs.

Hi!

My code in `Homura.cmdJavafx()` does trim off whitespace, but I did completely forget about it here. Thanks for pointing it out!

I'm not really sure how to restructure my code at the moment, since the parsing is currently done in `Homura.java` within each individual command processing. But I can at least fix the bug here.

Thanks!

I parsed them within my [Deadline.java](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/ip/blob/master/src/main/java/homura/Deadline.java) and [Event.java](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/ip/blob/master/src/main/java/homura/Event.java) files by making a constructor for it.

I think you could argue that using "as a" here is still fine. "A" and "an" are allomorphs of the same morpheme in English, with "a" being the underlying representation and "an" only being used before vowel sounds. The context of the header should be independent of the rows (since you can have multiple rows, some of which use "a" while others use "an"), so the base form "a" would get used instead.

I have also tried running the following code, and it runs properly, so I'm pretty sure that the issue should be the newline that appears out of nowhere

    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        String s0 = "d | 0 | CS2103T | 2025-02-28";
        String s1 = "d | 0 | you | 2010-01-01";
        Deadline d0 = (Deadline) Storage.fromStr(s0);
        Deadline d1 = (Deadline) Storage.fromStr(s1);

I tried adding a `.strip()` just now (shown below), and it does seem to properly parse that line, but now errors on the event line for what seems to be a similar reason.

'''java
    /**
     * Converts a storage string to the object.
     *
     * @param s The storage string.
     * @return The object derived from the storage string.
     */
    public static Deadline fromStorageStr(String s) ``{``
        assert s.startsWith("d");
        ArrayList&lt;String> ss = HomuraUtils.split(s, Storage.DIVIDER);
        Deadline ans = new Deadline(ss.get(2), ss.get(3).strip());   //.strip() added
        if (ss.get(1).equals("1")) ``{``
            ans.setIsDone(true);
        ``}``
        return ans;
    ``}``
'''

Doing the corresponding modification to my `Event.fromStorageStr()` function as shown below now gets my code to run properly. But I'd still like to understand why this sort of behavior is happening to my code if possible.

'''java
    /**
     * Converts a storage string to the object.
     *
     * @param s The storage string.
     * @return The object derived from the storage string.

    public static Event fromStorageStr(String s) ``{``
        assert s.startsWith("e");
        ArrayList&lt;String> ss = HomuraUtils.split(s, Storage.DIVIDER);
        Event ans = new Event(ss.get(2), ss.get(3), ss.get(4).strip());   //.strip() added
        if (ss.get(1).equals("1")) ``{``
            ans.setIsDone(true);
        ``}``
        return ans;

The save and load feature (to my knowledge) worked fine when I first implemented it, but I haven't really tested that specific feature again until now. I'm not sure when the bug got introduced, but the formatting has remained the same throughout my development process, and I haven't really touched the logic of these functions since they were implemented.

I say this as someone who was originally opposed to the idea. I think that SLAP improves maintainability and readability for me in my iP. I remember in the first 1 or 2 weeks of the iP, about half of my code was just all in the main function. And it became quite hard to read. It feels easier to manage having every method being short (although I might not follow SLAP that well still). It was also somewhat easier to manage/maintain than my 200 line advent of code solutions in Python like [this one](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/Advent-of-Code/blob/main/AoC-2024/Day-16/2024-16-2.py) where I had little abstraction.

> doesn't make it harder for the reader to keep track of the logic than if it were placed all in one method?

The thing with this is that you don't have to keep track of all the logic. That's the power of abstraction, you only need to know the input and outputs. When some error arises, that's when you have to dig into the logic. I found that when I'm debugging, I have to trace through maybe 6 functions or so, but it wasn't too hard to tell whether the error was in the current function or the next function call.

I will admit that having to navigate through multiple functions was annoying though, it made me wish I had 4 monitors.

From my experience, ChatGPT is a great substitute for googling basic functions. For example, when implementing the GUI in week 4, the tutorial already contained most required things. But it did not tell me how to make the window close, so I tried asking ChatGPT, and it gave me the function I needed.

I think it would be bidirectional. 

The image implies that the function `write()` in Book requires the `Chapter` class to function since `getText()` is called in it.

The funciton `getText()` in Chapter requires the `Book` class to function since `getAuthor()` is called in it.

But it seems it should be the `src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands` directory.

Hi! Thanks for the above sample code.

I also just realized that some sample (possibly outdated) code was also [linked](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/0b11fdac00e19fedf3a8defc2a4f6b57d2708103#diff-399c284cb892c20b7c04a69116fcff6ccc0666c5230a1db8e4a9145def8fa4ee) in the site

Hi! Sorry for the late reply, I was busy with other things for a bit.

The issue came up again as I was doing the [Updating Storage task](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html#updating-storage) of [Week 6 tP Task 4 Tutorial 2](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week6/project.html#4-get-familiar-with-the-codebase) where I couldn't find any usage of `JSonAdaptedPerson` outside of 2 or 3 places.

Tried your suggestion and it seemed to fix it for `execute` at least, thanks!

As an extra note, you can add `*.class` to your `.gitignore` file so that these get excluded from `git add .` automatically.

Normally, binary files are not supposed to be committed since git is optimized for human readable text files, and anyone who wants the `.class` files can regenerate them by compiling

To add onto this since the issue isn't closed yet, inside the implementation of your `equals()` method, you should also use the `equals()` method itself. So something like
'''java
public bool equals(Object o) ``{``
    if (o == null) ``{`` return false; ``}``
    if (!(o instanceof Class)) ``{`` return false; ``}``
    Class o_ = (Class) o;
    return (a == o._a) && (b == o_.b);
'''
might result in a bug since `a == o_.a` checks if the exact same instance of `a` is being used. Using 
'''java
public bool equals(Object o) ``{``
    if (o == null) ``{`` return false; ``}``
    if (!(o instanceof Class)) ``{`` return false; ``}``
    Class o_ = (Class) o;
    return a.equals(o_.a) && b.equals(o_.b);
'''
would be safer

@kumar2215 I personally find it easier to keep track of which branch is which when I put the date of creation. Putting it in front also means that the alphabetical sorting automatically makes it chronological.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Is this activity diagram notation right in the TB?**
</div>

I created a bug report for the team I tested saying their activity diagram notation had a mistake where the guard conditions posed in it were phrased as questions. At the time of reporting, I believed that this is considered wrong notation as I remembered from one of the videos that this should not be the case. However, the team responded with the following example from the TB saying that it's actually not wrong to have questions in guard conditions.

Now, my question is that is there an error in the following diagram or was I wrong to say you can't have questions inside guard conditions?

My team got 3 bug reports pointing to the same error in the DG. However, 2 of them had `severity.VeryLow` and the other had `severity.Medium`. The issue was a typo in the example command given as part of the `Instructions for manual testing` section of the DG. However, the typo should be easily identifiable as given by the right format of the command in the UG and another example in the same section using the right format, which could be why it was considered `severity.VeryLow` by the 2 testers.

So how should we resolve this?

**4. :fas-info-circle: What should the severity of the AB3 email bug be?**
</div>

If you continued using the Email class in your app without any modifications, then it's possible that a tester reported bug arising from this. The bug is that valid emails, at least according to the error message shown by it like `special+._-char@example.com` gets invalidated.

The restrictions for email provided (carried from AB3):
Emails should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:

The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
The domain name must:
end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

As such, `special+._-char@example.com` would be considered a valid email but it will get invalidated by any team's app that used the Email class without any modifications. This should be considered a `type.FunctionalityBug` but what severity should this bug get?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e48fbcf-2677-4175-9a20-51a40dab857e)

We are also asked to modify the respective tests for it as given in this [commit](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/53fa077fe4efc9f8d88d8e4d91bc5b6e1948cb58#diff-ff58f7c10338b34f76645df49b71ecb2bafaf7611b20e7ff59ebc98475538a01R36-R49).

However, if you were to just follow these changes. 3 of the new tests written will not pass or at least didn't pass in my case. After some debugging, I found the issue to be in the example code given in the image above.

In particular, this section:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a613432d-6db5-47a4-baf9-50d6825c840f)

`return String.format(message, Messages.format(personToEdit));` should just be `return String.format(message, personToEdit);`

In doing so, all of the tests manage to pass. Wanted to clarify if this is indeed a bug and whether anyone else is facing this issue.

**17. :fas-info-circle: [Discussion] Is SLAP really a good idea?**
</div>

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdf19ab9-1c97-4bbf-85d0-f79976d3d712)

Under the section of Code Quality, we are told to avoid deep nesting as __its harder for the reader to keep track of the logic__. I agree with this and this is usually fixed with guard clauses.

However, we are then also told to follow SLAP where we should try to use the highest level of abstraction as much as possible as shown below.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33e6ca53-d4a2-4033-b445-00b9262b8e2a)

My question is then doesn't this feel contradictory with the reasoning to avoid deep nesting as if the methods being called are scattered in many different classes, doesn't make it harder for the reader to keep track of the logic than if it were placed all in one method?

Personally, I understand that having a very long method is bad for readability but if it's not too long, should SLAP still be enforced because I feel that it makes it harder to keep track of the logic in doing so sometimes and may be harder when trying to debug than if it were placed all in one place.

Just wanted to know other people's views on this.

If you are not aware of it already, IntelliJ has this feature where you can do most of the things you need to do with git with a similar (and in my opinion more intuitive) way to SourceTree. I personally find it much easier to use and it can help fix any git issues accidentally caused without needing to know the exact CLI command for it.

So yeah, just want to put this out there if you are not aware of it.

The stuff that you do for each case in the if statements can be put into its own function I guess, leaving with each case to just a single statement calling it. That's what I did at least.

Your creating a new scanner object each time readCommand is called. I believe that's the issue. Have one instance be created in the constructor and use that only.

I wanted to do the same too! But I believe I found a better way.

This is how I did it:
'''java
/**
 * Displays the goodbye message when the program ends.
 */
@Override
public void sayBye() ``{``
    String response = "Bye. Hope to see you again soon!";
    showRoverResponse(response);
    new Timer().schedule(new TimerTask() ``{``
        public void run() ``{``
            Platform.exit();
        ``}``
    ``}``, 2000);
``}``
'''

This allows the application to say the goodbye message and then close after 2s.
I got it from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21974415/how-to-close-this-javafx-application-after-showing-a-message-in-a-text-area-elem).

@Bryce-3D Just want to point out that if the user input is prefixed by some whitespace, say " bye", the code above would not catch this. So, you might want to trim it first. Also, I think it's better for the user input to be processed inside a command class and then it calls the Ui to exit from there instead. Just a suggestion.

@Bryce-3D Hi Bryce, I just saw your repo. For restructuring your code, I suggest that the parsing of commands should be done inside the `Parser` class instead of `Homura.java`. You can also consider placing the classes into their own packages inside the Homura package: `parser`, `ui`, `exceptions`, ... to tidy up the code although it isn't a requirement.

@veehz I did think of the scenario where I may end up adding new values to the Enum. However, in my case the Enum is not related to the commands, and I don't I will ever need to add more values for it. And even if I do, I would check for its usages to see if there is anything to be updated there. That being said, I do agree that throwing an exception in the default case is also a good idea too and so I will do that.

> The thing with this is that you don't have to keep track of all the logic.

That is kind of my point though because isn't this contradicting the reasoning for not using deep nesting?

> That's the power of abstraction; you only need to know the input and outputs.

I would agree if that it was the case of recursion but not if the logic was spread among many other methods.

> I will admit that having to navigate through multiple functions was annoying though

Ya that's what I would want to avoid as much as possible.

Why are there .class files in your repo in the first place? Any sort of binary or files resulting from compilation should not be placed in a repo. This is done by adding them in the .gitignore file. Did you forget to include *.class in your gitignore?

In this case, you should follow its advice and manually delete those class files and any sort of binaries that shouldn't be in the repo.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e84de9d4-ccf5-400d-9c48-46450e9bbc9d)

While that is true, remember that the Planned Enhancements section can only hold up to the team size x 2 items. So, even if they do put that they still incur the opportunity cost of putting some other bug or actual enhancement there which can be reported as a bug. So, this just narrows down the kind of bugs you should find during the PE. At least that's how I see it.

The team I tested had features where data could be imported and exported to json and csv files. The commands work in general. However, after exporting the data and then importing the data. The order of the data shown in the display is in a different order than the one in the json file. I think this can cause a false sense of panic when users don't see the same first few data being in the same order in the display as in the data file and so would classify this as `severity.Medium`. In real world cases, the data might be much more and making sure all the data got imported as is can be troublesome if the order differs.

What severity would you give this bug?

I face a similar problem to @zhenglong1603.

> Hi prof and others, tried the new Examplify assessment and the search functioned worked very well on my end for the new pdf as compared to the mock exam with the the previous pdf attachment. Previous pdf took 3 minutes to load the results whereas search results for this pdf file was almost instant
OS:Windows 11
Examplify: 3.7.2

The search works instantaneously for the other pdf but not the one with the Textbook where it just loads until the end of the exam. I think the pdf in use may be the issue. Tried it with the `PDF created with Windows` one as well, same issue. Same windows OS and examplify version as @zhenglong1603.

As a control, I tried doing the same search function on the same Textbook pdf but using Acrobat instead. There were no issues when doing so. So, for some reason examplify seems to have an issue with loading the search results for the Textbook pdf but not the other pdf which has more pages.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7893a0f-26a2-41bb-a43f-9c688c883b29)

Under this part of the MCQ it was mentioned that because CCDs are meant to model the problem domain and not the solution domain, anything related to the solution itself should not be mentioned. This included the representation of `instructors` in the form of an `ArrayList`.

However it is also fine for CCDs to show the data type of the attribute as is covered in the tutorial and seen later in the lecture slides, which seems to be somewhat contradictory.

**10. :fas-info-circle: Command input validation**
</div>

Hi Prof @damithc ,

After reviewing the PE-D issues raised by my peers regarding input validation, I would appreciate your guidance on several points that have caused some confusion.

The main areas I'd like clarification on are:

1. User Responsibility vs. Software Validation. 
    The point on "overzealous input validation" (considered a `type.FeatureFlaw`) was particularly confusing to me, as it meant that such relaxations allows for more invalid inputs. I have listed a few examples below.
   - For name inputs: Should we support international characters (e.g., "عَبْدُ الرَّحْمَن"), even if it means relaxing validation (ie. potential invalid names)?
   - For faculty names: Should we allow single-character inputs, or implement stricter validation?
   - For phone numbers: Enforcement of a minimally 3 digits, although it is unexpected for people to possess such numbers?

2. Application Requirements
   - Regarding issue #544 (TLD of an email is technically not required, although highly encouraged).

3. User Guide Documentation
   - Should input constraints be explicitly documented, or should we maintain AB3's approach of handling issues within the application itself?

4. Unique Identifier Requirements
   - Should fields like name, phone number, and email be unique identifiers? Personally, I felt that there was no need to considering the fact that there may be cases of all happening. (i.e. two or more people may temporarily share the same contact in the event that their original form of contact is unavailable).

1.  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a391c9-4254-4f61-9891-bb94a6256b22)
This diagram would be considered alright as well (ignoring the comments in grey).
1. I did not really understand why it is a composition from 'Action' to Task' and an aggregation from 'History' to 'Repeatable'. Meaning to say that if there was no "... part of..." comment under 'tasks' aggregation would also be acceptable?
1. I would like to confirm that 'ActionFactory' has a dependency on both 'ActionX' and 'ActionY' because the creation does not imply the association, but the addition of both 'ActionX' and 'ActionY' implies that it must be associated to a 'History' object?
If so, I am not too sure why that is the case, as it seems possible for 'ActionFactory' to have a method signature along the lines of 'add(History history)', which would then imply a dependency instead of an association I believe?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d527252-d441-43ff-9349-b8e0264d7f39)

1. As for the second object diagram, presumably 'ActionX' would be added to the 'history' attribute of 'History'? If so, is there a way to show it in the object diagram as well considering the fact that it may not be the only object in 'history'?

Hi, with regards to the following object diagram (under [week 8 topics](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week8/topics.html))

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e976c52d-eb43-41ae-b5d3-7bf93f92245a)

I am unsure if I am looking too much into it, but nowhere does the demo implementation actually state that the `Lid` object has the `Box` object from which it was called, considering only the following excerpt was given.

```
class Lid ``{``
    Box box; // The box for which this is the lid
``}``
```

It would seem that the arrow from `lid` back to `b1` is based on the assumption that the `lid` attribute that the `Box` object possesses would be the `Lid` for itself, but due to the lack of implementation details, would it not have been better for `lid` object to have another arrow to an unnamed `Box` object?

Thank you!

I am currently looking through one of the week 7 exercises

> Consider a simple movie ticket vending machine application. Every week, the theatre staff will enter the weekly schedule as well as ticket price for each show. A customer sees the schedule and the ticket price displayed at the machine. There is a slot to insert money, a keypad to enter a code for a movie, a code for the show time, and the number of tickets. A display shows the customer's balance inside the machine. A customer may choose to cancel a transaction before pressing the “buy” button. Printed tickets can be collected from a slot at the bottom of the machine. The machine also displays messages such as "Please enter more money”, “Request fewer tickets" or "SOLD OUT!”. Finally, a "Return Change" button allows the customer to get back his unspent money.

Hello,

I was looking at the following UML diagram:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2ac9f8a-367d-47b4-9575-802107f4238e)
Here, the `Square` object is an attribute of the `Board` object, specifically 100 of them. Presumably the implementation could possibly be something like this, where `Square[]` is implemented as an instance level variable.

```
class Board ``{``
    private Square[100] squares;
    ...
``}``
```

Would this thus be considered aggregation, or even composition as well? If so does it make sense to replace the association with that of aggregation, and label it with a multiplicity of 100?

**20. :fas-info-circle: JavaFX GUI Bugs**
</div>


Hello,

I have been trying to enable my UI to have both selectable text and colorable at the same time. (example below showing both red and black text, that can be selected / highlighted and copied, )

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a699a46-98f6-499c-8889-33800c817cbf)
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ade6e03a-395c-46ff-a92e-4e73cb455573)

After some digging around, I realized that it is likely for a `WebView` object to be required, as the default `Text` objects do not support it. The alternative solution seems to be to create a custom `TextFlow` object that contains a `TextArea` object, which is what I have done. However, this comes with a few limitations:

1. `TextArea` objects seems to have different natural margins due to the presence of a `ScrollBar`, I have tried different solutions online to try to disable, it, but to no avail. The `ScrollBar` would come back sometimes upon rescaling the window itself. Trying to manually disable it within the code somehow seems to only remove the visibility, but not the functionality itself. 
1. I have provided the related code segments at the bottom of this post.

> Demo of 1980x1080 at 125% scale.
> ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/563d13e1-11eb-4c9e-a7c7-35b60810c558)
> Demo of other scales and resolutions tested. (This one was done at 1980x1080 at 150% scale. 100% yields the same results)
> ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29835ea3-c193-4474-8544-7432d6178c1d)

1. This is very likely due to the fact that my resize values are hardcoded to the scale that I am working in. However, attempts at trying to dynamically retrieve padding and layout values thus far has yielded no luck, it either ended up completely breaking the UI (not sure why), or resulting in all resolutions and scales misaligning. A list of things I have tried:
    1. `ScrollBar scrollBarv = (ScrollBar) textArea.lookup(".scroll-bar:vertical");` and `scrollBarv.setDisable(true);` as suggested [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14206692/javafx-textarea-hiding-scroll-bars) led to `TextArea` breaking apart, presumably due to the type change.
    1. I sifted through my past commits and found [another implementation which I referenced](https://github.com/ChinZJ/ip/blob/c315d1ed7e4ef90a01c8f79b10cd278b442c3308/src/main/java/botling/gui/DialogBox.java). I remember this being very buggy as well and required hardcoding of values in attempts to align the text. Dynamic calculations were not feasible.
  
Therefore, considering the fact that the purpose of the `TextArea` object here is just to copy text, and the fact that it works completely fine at a common default scale and resolution, I was wondering if:
1. I could just leave it as is and report it as a known bug, and encourage users to just select the entire text instead to copy since that is a viable option considering the relatively short messages provided by the chatbot on average.
1. If I were to want to have this feature in my AB3 as well, can such UI bugs be ignored? Or will there be penalization for bad UI code and thus better to be excluded.

Relevant code used:
```
        textArea = new TextArea();
        textArea.setWrapText(true);
        textArea.setManaged(false);
        textArea.setEditable(false);
        // For rescaling:
        textArea.setLayoutX(6); // hardcoded
        textArea.setLayoutY(6); // hardcoded
        textArea.resize(getWidth() - 11.8, getHeight()); // hardcoded
```

**21. :fas-info-circle: Semantics of DoWithinPeriodTasks**
</div>


Hello,

I was taking a quick scan through the extensions list, and noted there exists an extension "B-DoWithinPeriodTasks", which states:

> "Provide support for managing tasks that need to be done within a certain period e.g., collect certificate between Jan 15 and 25th."

May I know what is the functional difference between this and the currently implemented `Event` class which also has a `from` and a `to` specification?

Thank you!

Minor nitpick. 
I notice that some comments, particularly those after `//` sometimes have [no spaces (see `//high-level step XXX` in the tagged section. ](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week5/topics.html#implementation-code-quality-readability-intermediate-slap-hard). Same goes for some of the other sections as well.

From the video as well:

However, there are other [sections (see `// parameter reused as a variable`)](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week5/topics.html#implementation-code-quality-error-prone-practices-basic-don-t-recycle-variables-or-parameters)(as well as within the [coding standard](// parameter reused as a variable), that enforces the spacing after `//`).

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34d3f419-fbab-4a04-8775-7b3278203cf9)

Thus, I would like to clarify if both are acceptable.

It says under Object Diagrams that "Multiplicities are omitted. Reason: an association line in an object diagram represents a connection to exactly one object (i.e., the multiplicity is always 1)." However, I am confused about the translation to its respective class Diagram.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baf29b19-06ad-4f91-939d-b1b107d86148)

   Here, the association in the object diagram should be between 1 unit to 1 item object. 
   However, option 2 seems to be right as well because "Both class diagrams allow one `Unit` object to be linked to one `Item` object." 
   Is there a "relaxation" of sorts from the Object diagram to the Class diagram? Else should it not be strictly 1 to 1 (which is option 1 only)?
&lt;/details>

**25. :fas-info-circle: UML Notation Class Diagrams Empty / Omitted Compartments.**

Under UML class diagrams, it is possible for there to be a class with attributes or operations (methods) compartments omitted, or empty. 
I was wondering if they represented the same thing, or it would be dependent on personal preference (which would then have to be specified by the creator of the diagram).

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b83a7e22-65ca-40cb-9bde-8a35f04b8719)


For instance, having empty compartments could suggest that the class either 1) has no attributes and methods (thus explicitly leaving it blank) or 2) should have attributes and methods but has not been hashed out yet.

**26. :fas-info-circle: System Garbage Collection (GC)**
</div>


Hello, I am currently trying to set up JUnit tests for creating a file on hard disk. 

Currently I am trying out the following function, which should ensure that I have a `history.txt` file before every `@Test`.

```
    @BeforeEach
    private void createTempHistoryFile() throws IOException ``{``
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(
                new FileWriter("./data/history.txt"))) ``{``
            File dataFolder = new File("data");
            File historyFile = new File("./data/history.txt");
            if (!dataFolder.exists()) ``{``
                dataFolder.mkdir();
            ``}``
            if (!historyFile.exists()) ``{``
                historyFile.createNewFile();
            ``}``

        // Create test cases to write to file...
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

I am trying to create two tests, one where `history.txt` is not available and one where the `data` folder is not available. 
For this, I am calling `historyFile.delete()` and then `dataFolder.delete()` respectively.
I am not sure why but the files are not being deleted despite the `BufferedWriter` being closed in the `try` block. 
My code does not have any other resources open in the path (I do not think that `historyFile` and `dataFolder` are resources since they do not have a `close()` method).
It seems that running `System.gc()` solves this issue, though I am unsure why. [A discussion on stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66540/when-does-system-gc-do-something) seems to suggest that:
1. Running `System.gc()` in general is not recommended due to affecting performance.
2. It is not guaranteed that GC is always run, and depends on factors such as the JVM itself.

Any explanations or links / resources are deeply appreciated!

**27. :fas-info-circle: JUnit organisation**
</div>


I am currently looking through the[ JUnit basics](https://se-education.org/se-book/cppToJava/junit/basic/index.html) and noticed that test methods can also contain multiple test cases:

```   
    @Test
    public void intDivision_nonZeroDivisor_success() throws Exception ``{``
        // normal division results in an integer answer 2
        assertEquals(2, new IntPair(4, 2).intDivision());

        // normal division results in a decimal answer 1.9
        assertEquals(1, new IntPair(19, 10).intDivision());

        // dividend is zero but devisor is not
        assertEquals(0, new IntPair(0, 5).intDivision());
    ``}``
```
I was wondering if there was a recommended practice of sorts as to how to organize test cases. Should related test cases always be grouped into a single method? (Eg. one method for "valid inputs" and one for "invalid inputs").

Thank you!

After looking at [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18573998/bufferedwriter-works-but-file-empty/21155522) Stack Overflow article, calling `BufferedWriter.close()` might not be enough to flush the contents of the file to the disk immediately.

Hello @itstrueitstrueitsrealitsreal,

Thank you for the suggestions. I have tried `flush()` and `close()` at the end of the try block without `System.gc()` previously but it did not work.

Also as a side note, I am using try with resources (see the first link provided by @lavanyagarg112 ) which should close the `BufferedWriter` upon exiting the `try` block. 
If I am not mistaken, `close()` will perform an automatic `flush()`, which indeed seems to be the case as the file is generated without me having to perform either of the 2 actions.

Hi @lavanyagarg112 ,

Thank you for the inputs. Apologies, for not putting the full test here previously. I have attached one basic test unit which involves deleting the file (but keeping the folder), and seeing if the code is capable of creating a new file in place.

```
    @BeforeEach
    public void createTempHistoryFile() throws IOException ``{``
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(
                new FileWriter("./data/history.txt"))) ``{``
            File dataFolder = new File("data");
            File historyFile = new File("./data/history.txt");
            if (!dataFolder.exists()) ``{``
                dataFolder.mkdir();
            ``}``
            if (!historyFile.exists()) ``{``
                historyFile.createNewFile();
            ``}``

            // Default test case
            String fileHistory = "todo\n \ntrue\n"
                    + "deadline\ntonight!\n \nfalse\n"
                    + "event\n23 Jan 2025 0000\n24 Jan 2025 2359\n \ntrue";
            writer.write(fileHistory);
        ``}``
    ``}``

    @AfterEach
    public void restoreSystemInput() ``{``
        System.setIn(systemIn);
        System.gc();
    ``}``

    @Test
    public void folderPresentTest() ``{``
        File historyFile = new File("./data/history.txt");
        historyFile.delete();

        String expectedMsg = "\t Attempting to retrieve history...\n"
                + "\t Data folder found!\n"
                + "\t No history file found! Creating history file...\n";

        TaskListWriter tester = new TaskListWriter();
        TaskList testList = new TaskList();
        String actual = tester.restore(testList);

        assertEquals(expectedMsg, actual);
        assertEquals(0, testList.size());
        assertEquals("", testList.fileString());
        assertEquals("", testList.list());
    ``}``
```

The following error message will be shown:
```
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <	 Attempting to retrieve history...
	 Data folder found!
	 No history file found! Creating history file...
> but was: <	 Attempting to retrieve history...
	 Data folder found!
	 History file found! Restoring data...
```
Which suggests that the file was actually not being deleted.

Thank you for the tool suggestions as well. I will try it out when I have the time.

Hello @chiageng ,

Thank you for sharing. I will try to refactor my code to use the `TemporaryFolder` instead when I have the time.
However, I am not sure if that will solve the current problem, considering the fact that there seems to be some resource blocking the deletion of the file for my test cases.

Thank you everyone for the suggestions. I think my phrasing was not sufficiently clear, and I have provided a revision below. 

Definitely following English definitions, an 'Event' as well as a 'DoWithinPeriodTask' have nuanced differences. However, in this context, such differences are (arguably) dubious.
For example, many have suggested that 'Event' tasks should be unmarkable for the entirety of its duration. Indeed, some events, such as conferences requires one's time to be blocked out for its entire duration. However, other events such as sales, exhibitions (and even some conferences) etc., will not require (and sometimes illogical) for one to attend for the entirety of its duration. This (to me) should still be an 'Event' instead of a 'Task' as attending the 'Event' itself may be completely optional, compared to the necessities of a 'Task'.

Moreover, the above example suggests that such nuanced differences are captured by additional features as well as functionalities that has to be implemented. This is not what is specifically required for a 'DoWithinPeriodTask', which states that it is merely a task that needs to be done within a certain period of time, ie. a 'startDate' as well as an 'endDate'. This is exactly the same as what the 'Event' class currently supports. Then at its core, this would essentially be a code duplication, with the only exception of the '[E]' tag that is used to demarcate the 'Event class.

Thus, is it fair for me to say that the creating a new 'DoWithinPeriodTask' class would effectively result in a duplication of the existing 'Event' classs functionality, with the exception of the '[E]' tag?

Hi @zuoshihua , 

May I know what you mean by `./gradlew run` not exiting? 
When `Platform.exit()` is called, it should cause `Applicaition.launch(...)` to return, thus terminating the main method in `Launcher.java` which is the `mainClass`.

Thank you for sharing @zuoshihua 
That is because `Timer`s [default construction](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Timer.html) is a non daemon thread, changing the boolean to true via the following will allow the program to exit.
```
            new Timer(true).schedule(new TimerTask() ``{`` 
                public void run() ``{``
                    Platform.exit();
                ``}``
            ``}``, 1000);
```
Not too sure about the validity of this, and I agree that running `PauseTransition` indeed should be "better".

Thanks Prof @damithc, @iamdiluxedbutcooler, @IanCheah, @cth06-Github, and @Feng1231 for your input!

I've made the following updates:
1. Added more detailed pictures and explanation to the main message
1. Found a past commit of another attempted method.

Regarding the technical implementation (I left these here instead of the main message as I do not remember the exact implementations that I have done, and the changes were not saved as commits):
- Experimenting with `prefWidthProperty()` (as well as `prefRowCount()` and `minWidth()`) but recall experiencing the following issues:
    - The scroll bar reappears when resizing to full screen
    - Particularly long inputs will result in overflowing out of the `TextFlow` object boundaries.
    - Imperfect matching of the text (similar to the image). This I suspect is due to the precision that `prefWidthProperty()` has as changing values within the second decimal place does not result in any changes. This results in a slight misalignment, where characters such as semicolons `;` can easily cause misalignment between the two.
- I attempted to use `listener()` to enforce the disabling of the scrollbar, as well as dynamically updating the width and height of the `TextArea`, but also resulted in similar issues listed above. Certain inputs also causes a stream of errors to be thrown within the console. 

For the iP, I'm considering leaving this feature in because I have spent a considerable amount of time on it and unfortunately I think I need to cut my losses. I am also abit hesitant to completely remove it as it is a core part of my UI change. Thus considering the fact that most users would probably not even use the feature at the current stage of development of the application, I am hoping that there will be no penalization as mentioned by Prof @damithc .

If I have spare time I will definitely look into this to try and replicate what I have previously tested and update accordingly, as well as look into the resources shared by everyone.

Thank you again!

Hi @starchypotatocode , thank you so much for the suggestions.

I am not too sure if I missed out anything. 
For 1, I have previously included `fx-border-width` for `.text-flow` in line 9, so instead I tried to add another under `.text-flow .content` in line 19.
I have made modifications as suggested in points 2 and 3.

Unfortunately it does not seem to work on my end. At the default settings of 1920x1080 and 125% scaling, the textArea is also scrollable again (can be seen when selecting the text and scrolling)

Also for different scales (150% and 100%), the full screen application results in misalignment for me. 
(for 150%)

(for 100%)
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cab95c8a-d4ee-4062-82d4-d56d37b82cb1)

May I know if you still have the files that you have tried? If so could I trouble you to share them with me? Perhaps you made some additional modifications that fixed the issues.

Hi Prof @damithc , 

I am facing the same issues too, tried the above and all solutions posted are currently not working for me. I have contacted CIT for assistance.

May I know if it is possible to simply allow for the exam to be open book closed internet? That way we can access the pdf directly which seems to be working for most people instead.

For consolidation:
1. Foo activation bar is misaligned for do() method call
1. Sequence of second method which `bar` calls on `foo` object is reversed.
1. Return arrows should be dashed
1. while should be loop
1. Bottom right of the loop box should be cut off

Additional errors(?)
1. operation names should be stated (only `do()` is labeled so far)

something like this, and also replace the alternate path with a parallel bar. The one in question I have boxed it in green and pointed an arrow to it

I think it should not be shown since
> An object diagram shows an object structure at a given point of time. (from textbook)

and

> dependency is a need for one class to depend on another without having a direct association in
the same direction

then dependencies are not really relevant to it by definition since dependencies can be viewed more as a "implementation level" relationship while object diagrams are more "instance-level"

Hi prof @damithc 
If we are told to have associations as lines instead of attributes would that not apply to all classes except primitives?

Other than that may I also ask if there is anything else missing/incorrect?

Hi Prof and everyone, I know it's quite late now, but I still want to verify the diagrams that I drew below. The ones that I'm not sure of the most are the object and sequence diagrams.

Moreover, I want to ask if we have to specify the multiplicity if the question does not state that, but the code implicitly implies (i.e. 0..1 in the class diagram below).

When I changed my class name in IDEA IntelliJ, all presence of "Duke" in the project folder was accidentally changed to that new name. And now the changes appeared in Git as follows.
What do you think I should do now? I cannot edit the README.md file back to the original, but if I skip the changes in Sourcetree, it will always show "Uncommitted changes".

@damithc Hi Prof, I'm trying to follow the forking workflow, but I still made some careless mistakes, like editing on the local `master` branch (instead of creating a new one before that), which leads to not being able to switch to a new branch. As you may have noticed, I tried to revert those commits, but unfortunately, it worsened the current situation.

What should I do now? I can't even push back to the `origin` repo (it gives an error message as below).

Anyway, after consulting @xplus2g4 and ChatGPT, I finally found a way to resolve it. Basically, just configure `pull.rebase` to false, and then pull as usual (and resolve merge conflicts).

I will leave this issue open for a while in case any bad effect from this action may occur.

> [@minhkiwi14](https://github.com/minhkiwi14) If you committed to the master branch accidentally but have not pushed those commits to the team repo yet, the best remedy is to either, (a) delete those rogue commits, or, (b) move them to a branch, and follow the forking workflow to incorporate those commits properly into the team repo via a PR.
> 
> This way, you own master branch can remain identical to the team repo master branch, as it should.

> [@damithc](https://github.com/damithc) Hi Prof,

> Just wanted to clarify a few things regarding the 10% and 2% LoC limit:
> 
> 1. Is the 2% margin meant specifically for functional code changes (what is counted as functional?), or does it include cosmetic lines (e.g., line wrapping, javadocs, etc.) as well?
> 2. Do changes to images (e.g., updating UI screenshots, diagrams, .puml) count towards the LoC limit?
> 3. Lastly, how severe is the penalty if we slightly exceed the limit due to necessary fixes? Just trying to better understand the trade-offs before making the call.

Hi, this is quoted from the course website:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35a1f72c-5ed2-45d6-bd08-01d3ea45fd27)

So this means line wrapping, JavaDoc comments, etc. also count as long as it is in the `src/main/java` folder. Other things won't affect the LoC limit.

Thank you for your response. However, that team's section has the number of enhancements which is clearly smaller than the team size * 2 (i.e. there's no team with less than 3 people). Is it still considered a bug?

> [@minhkiwi14](https://github.com/minhkiwi14) It is not disclosed but you can be assured that it will put the ones with the 'right behaviours' in front of others. So, if you aim for the accurate severity, and if you choose the lower severity when in doubt, the accuracy bonus marks will enable you to earn more total marks than if you tried to maximise marks by claiming higher severity and ended up being not very accurate.

Thank you Prof!

1. Because the question mentioned that "A Handout object **_composed_** of at least 2 and no more than 5 Section objects".

> `cover page` is the role. The object is a `Handout`. This case is a bit borderline as to if this is aggregation (i.e., brochure acts as a container for a bunch of handouts) or composition (handouts are part of the brochure). However, composition is not 'expected' in the answer, as there is no additional hints to suggest it is composition. So, either way is acceptable.

Hi Prof, can I ask if we don't show compositions in the diagram even if the question explicitly asks for it, will the diagram be acceptable?

If the arrow is bidirectional this means Brochure B must have the cover Handout A if Handout A can reference Brochure B, which does not match the intended behaviour. So it's best to draw it as 2 unidirectional arrows

Tester A and tester B report the same bug, with A reporting as `severity.Low` and B reporting as `severity.Medium`. The dev team marks B as a duplicate of A, hence B's severity is automatically lowered to `severity.Low`. May I clarify the following:

* Should the dev team also justify the automatic lowering of severity in the response to B (as they would in any other situation where the severity is lowered normally)?
* Is tester B allowed to contest the severity downgrade, without contesting the duplicate status (i.e., the tester accepts that this is a duplicate of A)?

* I make changes to 2 lines in a PR, then in a later PR, make changes to those same 2 lines. Does this count as changing 2 or 4 lines?

May I clarify a few things:
* For the purpose of Tutorial 2, since we won't be merging the PR, does it matter if checks fail (i.e., does the grading script require checks to pass for Tutorial 2)?
* Does this mean that for our tP, most of our code has to be covered by at least one test (from a quick Google search, I presume a line is covered if it has been executed at least once during the execution of tests)?
* The 75.26% figure seems to be the coverage of the whole codebase (before considering the PR). Does this mean that changes we make cannot decrease the percent coverage of the codebase (and if not, what percent coverage would allow the Codecov check to pass)?

In week 2, I used Java varargs in my iP. Then in week 4, I saw that `A-Varargs` was an (optional) increment, so I added the `A-Varargs` tag to the relevant commit in week 2 (as suggested in the FAQ [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/ip-w2.html)).

However, in the process of implementing `Level-10`, I removed the only method that uses varargs. May I check if I should still leave the `A-Varargs` tag there (since that commit did add varargs), or remove it (since the current state of my iP doesn't make use of it)?

**14. :fas-info-circle: 💡Tip: Edit `checkstyle.xml` to suppress indentation warnings for lambda-style switch statements**
</div>

###### The original discussion on this topic can be found at #68. The solution is posted here as a tip to be captured in #117.

## Context

The [coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#layout) allows for indented `case` blocks in lambda-style switch statements (but not for conventional switch statements). So the following is allowed:
'''java
int size = switch (condition) ``{``
    case ABC -&gt; 1;
    case DEF -&gt; 2;
    case XYZ -&gt; 3;
    default -&gt; 0;
``}``
'''
However, the [Checkstyle configuration](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle) provided enforces a relative indentation level of 0 for all `case` blocks, including those in lambda-style switch statements. This results in false positive error messages when running Checkstyle.

## Solution

Insert the following at line 39 of `checkstyle.xml`:
'''xml
&lt;!-- Suppresses indentation check for lambda-style switch statements -->
&lt;module name="SuppressionXpathSingleFilter">
    &lt;property name="checks" value="Indentation"/>
    &lt;property name="query" value="//SWITCH_RULE/descendant-or-self::node()"/>
&lt;/module>
'''
This suppresses indentation checks for lambda-style switch statements (without suppressing checks for conventional switch statements).

> [!CAUTION]
> Within the lambda-style switch statement, _all_ indentation checks are suppressed (to our knowledge, there doesn't seem to be a way to suppress just the `caseIndent` rule). You should ensure that indentation within that block still follows the coding standard.

**15. :fas-info-circle: 💡Tip: Edit `SceneBuilder.cfg` to fix JavaFX version as 17**
</div>

I noticed that the [JavaFX tutorial (Part 4)](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart4.html) has this notice:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d265687b-c55a-43ea-9a9b-7ba0b9a64231)

This can be avoided by editing `SceneBuilder.cfg` to include the following line:
```
java-options=-Djavafx.version=17
```

Scene Builder will now keep the JavaFX version as 17, eliminating the need to manually correct the version number in the FXML file.

> [!NOTE]
> If you edit `SceneBuilder.cfg` while Scene Builder is open, these changes will not take effect until Scene Builder is restarted.

<details>
<summary>Locating <code>SceneBuilder.cfg</code> on Windows</summary>
<br/>

1. Locate Scene Builder's installation path. By default, this should be `C:/Users/``{``user``}``/AppData/Local/SceneBuilder`.
    - If you cannot find `AppData`, go to View > Show > Hidden Items in File Explorer, or Win+R and run `%localappdata%`.
    - If Scene Builder is installed somewhere else, you may locate it by finding it through the Start Menu and selecting "Open file location". If this opens a location with Scene Builder as a shortcut, right-click on it and select "Open file location" again.
2. Navigate to `app/` and `SceneBuilder.cfg` should be there.

**16. :fas-info-circle: checkstyle.xml - order of import statements**
</div>

The recommended [checkstyle configuration](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle) imposes the following order of import statements:
1. Static imports
2. Standard java/javax imports
3. `org` imports
4. `com` imports

However, this does not cover imports from within the project (as per the [coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#naming), the root name of the package for school projects should be the project or group name, so it wouldn't start with `org` or `com`). Checkstyle therefore raises an error unless project imports follow all other imports (i.e., they come in 5th in the above ordering).

May I ask if this is intended? My assumption would have been that project imports would be ordered somewhere near the top (in 1st or 2nd place), which isn't in conflict with the [coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#package-and-import-statements) (which just requires the ordering to be consistent).

**17. :fas-info-circle: checkstyle.xml doesnt distinguish lambda-style switch/case indentation**
</div>

Hi, as part of `Level-8`, I've visited the [Gradle tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html#running-checkstyle) which links to the [checkstyle tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html#configuring-checkstyle), which suggests using the checkstyle configuration [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle).

This configuration imposes a relative indentation level of 0 for all `case` statements (with the line `&lt;property name="caseIndent" value="0" />`). While this is consistent with [the coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#layout) for conventional `switch` statements, it does not take lambda-style `switch` statements into account. The coding standard allows lambda-style `switch` statements to have indented `case` blocks as follows:

> Lambda-style `switch` statements/expressions can have indented `case` blocks (as shown below):
> '''java
> switch (condition) ``{``
>     case ABC -&gt; method("1");
>     case DEF -&gt; method("2");
>     case XYZ -&gt; method("3");
>     default -&gt; method("0");
> ``}``
> '''
> '''java
> int size = switch (condition) ``{``
>     case ABC -&gt; 1;
>     case DEF -&gt; 2;
>     case XYZ -&gt; 3;
>     default -&gt; 0;
> ``}``
> '''

May I check if there is a way to modify `checkstyle.xml` such that it allows indented `case` blocks for lambda-style `switch` statements, while also imposing unindented `case` blocks for conventional `switch` statements?

@FabianHeng do you have any trailing whitespace in the output? I had a similar problem, and it turns out that was the issue (fixed by removing the trailing whitespace).

At first I couldn't identify the issue when running `diff` since whitespace is invisible, but identified it after running it through a [text comparison website](https://text-compare.com/) which highlighted the trailing whitespace.

As per the [Java Language Specification, section 8.4.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.9):

> When a method is invoked (§15.12), the number of actual arguments (and any explicit type arguments) and the **compile-time types of the arguments** are used, at compile time, to determine the signature of the method that will be invoked (§15.12.2). If the method that is to be invoked is an instance method, the actual method to be invoked will be determined at run time, using dynamic method lookup (§15.12.4).

So you can't rely on polymorphism for method parameters, since the method call looks at the compile-time type of the arguments.

However, you could define an instance method `toStorageString` (if `toString` is already being used for something else) in `Todo` and override it in `Deadline` and `Event`, so that calling `toStorageString` on the object will call the relevant method based on its runtime-type.

Thank you Prof. I tried to get the Checkstyle configuration to support lambda-style `switch` statements, but couldn't figure it out. I'm posting my approach here in case anyone else would like to attempt this (so that they don't waste too time much trying to do the same thing I did).

The closest I got was suppressing the `caseIndent` check for lines matching the regex `(case\s\S+|default)\s->`, but this couldn't be extended to lines within the `switch` statement that didn't have `case` or `default` . For example,

'''java
Task task = switch (type) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; new Todo(description); // works, suppresses correctly 
    case 'D' -&gt; ``{`` // works, suppresses correctly
        String dueBy = scanner.nextLine().trim(); // does not suppress since this line does not match the regex
        yield new Deadline(description, dueBy); // does not suppress
    ``}`` // does not suppress
    case 'E' -&gt; ``{`` // suppresses correctly
        String from = scanner.nextLine().trim(); // does not suppress
        String to = scanner.nextLine().trim(); // does not suppress
        yield new Event(description, from, to); // does not suppress
    ``}`` // does not suppress
    default -&gt; throw new InvalidFileFormatException(); // suppresses correctly
``}``;
'''
I used [SuppressWithNearbyTextFilter](https://checkstyle.org/filters/suppresswithnearbytextfilter.html) in my approach, and I think it's limited in that the regex it matches only checks line-by-line, so there isn't really a way to handle the case above.

For my iP, I'll likely suppress checkstyle for lambda-style `switch` statements. I'd like to leave this issue open for a while, in case anyone else has suggestions.

@kubrian I went down another rabbit hole, and after seeing [this fix](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml#L294) used for a related issue, I seem to have come up with a solution. It still suppresses the whole `Indentation` module for the scope of the switch statement (not just `caseIndent`), but at least we don't have to manually ignore the checks via `// CHECKSTYLE.OFF/ON Indentation` now.

Add the following section in the `TreeWalker` module (so at around line 39 of `checkstyle.xml`):

'''xml
&lt;!-- Suppresses indentation check for lambda-style switch statements -->
&lt;module name="SuppressionXpathSingleFilter">
    &lt;property name="checks" value="Indentation"/>
    &lt;property name="query" value="//SWITCH_RULE/descendant-or-self::node()"/>
&lt;/module>
'''

This should suppress indentation checks for lambda-style `switch` statements. I have also verified that this (correctly) does not suppress indentation checks for conventional `switch` statements (since these use `CASE_GROUP` instead of `SWITCH_RULE` in the AST).

@damithc may I ask if the above fix would be a suitable update for AB3? While it has a downside of hiding indentation violations within a lambda-style `switch` statement, such violations would also not be easily detected through the current configuration of Checkstyle, since the false positives make it difficult to identify actual indentation violations.

I'd guess that splitting along `\n` (even after passing through `Pattern.quote`) may not be the best way to split along newlines, due to CRLF vs LF issues. maybe using `String::lines()` to split might remove the need to use `.strip()` in your `Deadline` and `Event` classes?

assuming your remote repo is up-to-date with your local repo, you should change this parameter in `build.gradle` to `"chatbot.gui.Launcher"`

GitHub Pages uses a different Markdown processor than the one used on GitHub, in this case I suspect that the issue could be something along the lines of not having a blank line before/after the table (my table's Markdown looks similar to yours, except I have a blank line before and after my table, and GitHub Pages rendered it correctly back when I was using the default Markdown processor. Not sure that this is the exact issue though)

However, a better solution could be to switch the GitHub Pages Markdown processor to GFM (see #208). This helped me fix a few inconsistencies between the GitHub preview and the GitHub Pages render, notably line spacing inconsistencies and enabling the use of collapsed sections

> You could try checking your repository’s YAML under Configuration > YAML on the Codecov website

Thanks, but I had checked this too and it's correctly reflected on Codecov

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbcac25-0d75-428e-aa63-4e98eb57ba50)

The YAML seems to function correctly for the purpose of calculating the project coverage (by looking at the coverage badge), just that the report generated does not take the YAML into account

> Although since we are not dealing with subdirectories, I think `"src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/*"` should have worked.

That's my understanding too, and the file path does correctly match the regex generated by Codecov

I can try out the other paths suggested, though it's a little difficult to test out whether they work on the tP repo, and I doubt this is the issue anyway (since Codecov seems to recognise it correctly for project coverage), so I'll probably leave it as is and ignore the relevant lines in the report

I was going to ask if this means that the differences between these two styles are more semantic (rather than there being a functional difference), based on how similar they look on the course website:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69dc5f01-acfa-4495-8bdc-52af0c832422)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca2d7970-9f99-4db0-98a7-86a2db63452e)

however, I noticed that E2 appears twice here, and the course website notes that "The same event can be sent to multiple consumers". would this be the main functional difference between the two (since it probably wouldn't make sense for a transaction to be "executed" multiple times)?

`run` isn't part of `Factory`, but you have calls from `run` coming from `f:Factory`. you might want to repurpose your leftmost vertical line to be the scope of `run`, so method calls from `run` will branch off that line

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40a0ca09-29d6-4d83-ac84-eae74ab08896)
this part looks wrong in a few ways:
* `creator()` is a method in `Unit`, so the arrows associated with the call to and return from `creator()` are in the wrong direction
* the way this is drawn implies that `increase(1)` occurs during the execution of `creator()`, which isn't right. the code has `u.creator().increase(1)`, which means the whole of `creator()` happens, then `increase(1)` is called on the return value of `creator()`

not 100% sure how valid my points are, but here's my feedback on this diagram:
1. ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/625b869e-0578-4260-9d4c-4a4e97e2ca12)
   * I don't think the `run` arrow should be here, since `run` isn't a method of `f:Factory`. if you'd like to include the `run` method call, I think you can draw it pointing from an empty space on the left of the leftmost lifeline (so that it points to the leftmost lifeline).
   * similarly, the arrow from the leftmost lifeline to the `f:Factory` lifeline should be the `create` arrow, and the arrow from `f:Factory` to `u:Unit` should be the constructor `Unit(f)`
2. ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40fc255-f9a2-40c1-826f-e37f97c25057)
   * I'm not sure I agree with how this is drawn. having this activation bar here (circled in red) implies that a method of `f:Factory` is executing, and that method calls `increase`. however, it's `run` that calls `increase`. my drawing looks more like this (though I'm not sure on whether this is a good representation; would appreciate feedback from others): ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc8ea05e-a1bf-4331-8399-51d1f2c69ee6)
   * since `u` is no longer referenced after this point (and would be garbage collected), I have it marked for deletion

the rest of the diagram looks fine to me

ProgressWatcher implementing Watcher does not make Activity dependent on ProgressWatcher. the dependency exists because Activity references ProgressWatcher.MAX

if ProgressWatcher is deleted, Activity cannot compile (since ProgressWatcher.MAX is not defined), so Activity is dependent on ProgressWatcher. If UiWidget is deleted, Activity can still compile (Activity is not dependent on UiWidget)

**1. :fas-info-circle: Distribution of PE penalty among different group sizes**
</div>



I'd like to ask about how the bug penalties from the recent PE will vary in marks, based on team size (e.g team of 4 vs team of 6), since it was stated that bugs with all/no assignees will cause the marks to be distributed evenly across all team members. However, it seems this could disproportionately affect smaller teams compared to larger ones. Is there any adjustment planned to account for these team size differences?

My intuition tell me that there'll indeed be moderation based on team size, but I feel it'd be better to clarify officially.

Based on the code snippet, I believe it may be because of `sc.next()`

If your input is empty, it will throw a `NoSuchElementException`

Your while-loop causes `sc.next()` to keep reading the next valid input without checking if there still exists one, which is the most likely cause for this exception being thrown. 

Maybe you can try modifying your code to fix this!

In the CherryBot(String filePath) constructor, the following code is used:

'''Java    
        catch (Exception e) ``{``
            ui.showLoadingError();
            tasks = new TaskList();
        ``}``
'''
You're printing out an error message, and solving the issue in relation to this error in the next line of code. Sounds a bit weird right? Maybe printing error messages isn't actually necessary in every catch-block?

As for the list command saying there are no tasks even though there are tasks, have you considered that maybe the Tasklist you're looking at is a different instance from the Tasklist that your ListCommand is looking at? 

Hope this helps!

You can think of `Event` as stuff you would add onto your Calendar app, to be able to keep track of your daily schedule, and deconflict certain clashes accordingly.

On the other hand, `DoWithinPeriodTask` is more of stuff you add onto your Reminders app, to help your keep track of what tasks you need to complete within a certain period, in your own time. And this doesn't necessarily mean that you are pre-occupied throughout this whole duration.

SLAP drastically helps with code readability, and even though it may seem tedious having to carefully abstract your methods without accidentally getting the logic wrong, it pays off with much easier understanding and modification of the functions down the line.

Imagine if your database of customers suddenly starts displaying a certain group's ages wrongly, and you have 6k LOC to read through, only to discover that some developer messed up the calculation with an accidental backspace. With SLAP, that age calculation would likely be isolated within a dedicated AgeCalculator function, making it far easier to pinpoint and fix the error, saving you countless hours of debugging!

If you have multiple versions of Java installed, the easiest way to force your IDE to use Java 17 would be to remove all instances of non-Java 17 versions. Since you're on Windows, this can be done in Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a Program 

As for running the jar file, using `./gradlew run` is one way to run the jar file, but another way to run it directly is by tracing your filepath of your ip. Assuming you're using IntelliJ, the filepath is `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\IdeaProjects`, Try searching for IdeaProjects in C:\ if you can't find it. You should be able to double click on this jar file.

Hope this helps!

You can go to your repository's tags (or just add /tags in your repository URL) and look for the corresponding tag. Click the 3 dots on the right-side of the tag and press 'Delete tag') This deletes the tag that already exists in the remote.

Afterwards, you can try pushing the tags again, it should work now.

I feel that this is because 'authorised users' implies that the application should have a security feature. This in itself would also mean that it's not exactly a core functional requirement (unless it's an authenticator application), since security isn't always necessary for an application to function properly.

Sorry! I think I was rather vague in my answer, but what I'm trying to say is that 'authorisation' is not a core feature of an app (unless it is an authenticator app). Thus, having an 'authentication feature' is generally not necessary for an app to work, so it is classified as an NFR.

After all, there isn't a distinct difference between FRs and NFRs so this is perhaps one example that strays in-between both sides!

Forks are supposed to be this way, as you might not always be forking from your team org's repo (lets say, if you forked a repository about project-based learning). The issues with regards to the main repo is not related to you in any way. 

Forks are meant to copy over source code for your own independent experimentation, without any relation to the upstream repo, other than the fact that you forked it. (also notice how your own forks doesn't have any issue page)

The workflow runs the test cases across all operating systems, so it may pass on your local Windows OS but fail on other OSes.

> [@YosieSYX](https://github.com/YosieSYX) Closing all the PRs and issues connected to a milestone does not automatically close the milestone itself. It still has to be closed manually.

To add on, this is intended behaviour. GitHub doesn't automatically close milestones when an issue is completed (which may show the milestone as 100% complete if it's the only issue) because team members might need to add related issues later on. I believe a team member of yours may be the one manually closing these milestones.

I personally feel that input validation is rather subjective and context-dependent. This is also mentioned in the bug triaging page:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15d64c59-8db0-4620-a8bb-3736c6ee76d9)

For the supporting of international characters in point 1, it feels like a lose-lose situation, whereby you either allow it and get 'bug reports' that such non-ASCII characters are allowed. On the other hand, if you disallow it, you still get 'bug reports' that such names are considered valid but are not allowed. Hence, I believe that this jurisdiction is entirely up to the developer(s).

Phone numbers are also highly arguable. I noticed some bug reports complaining that they're allowed to intentionally enter an invalid phone number, and that it should be fixed by checking if it's 8 digits, and starts with either 6, 8 or 9. But, these 'professional' bug reporters simply assumed that the application would only be catered towards Singapore-numbers. So it's also valid to argue against their short-sightedness.

Unique identifies are also subjective as well, because like you mentioned, two or more people may temporarily share the same contact. But some people would still argue that these should be unique as well, submitting their 'bug reports' thinking that they're right. Again, it's up to how the developers want to affirm their stance on this.

I would put this as low, as I feel that emails like that not standard, and are very rare to come across.

Maybe you can take some inspiration from this screenshot:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ea7d120-2837-44e7-9c2f-2f975eeb3dcb)

Severity would thus depend on what the typo/mistake actually is, and whether it'll affect functionality. If it doesn't affect, then I'll classify it as `severity.VeryLow`.

If it affects the functionality, then I'll need to analyse how basic the command is. Based on its importance and frequency of usage, I'll classify it as `severity.Low` or `severity.Medium` accordingly.

I would also give this a `severity.Medium`, since it sounds like a usability issue and could also be argued as a potential data concern. Verifying that all the data you imported (when it's large) is going to be a hindrance when using the application in that case. 

It makes those who use excel sheets want to stay on excel sheets. But those that faithfully use the app will not encounter such issues.

Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. In the abstract Foo, `process()` doesn't seem to be abstract since it's neither italic nor has the ``{``abstract``}`` phrase beside it. 

Overriding `process()` in Bar will not affect compilation of the program and hence, the removal of it will not cause a compilation error. Thus, the statement is true.

Hi prof @damithc, I recently checked the course website and saw that the CS2103T Practical Exam is scheduled for April 11th from 4–6 PM. However, I have a performance on the same day from 3–4:10 PM at the University Cultural Centre, which would make it very rushed for me to arrive on time. Additionally, I have a second performance later that evening from 8–9:10 PM.

I am currently trying to coordinate with my instructors for the performance to see if there is any flexibility. In the meantime, I wanted to check if it might be possible to attend a makeup Practical Exam or have some buffer time for the exam. **Two of my friends** who are also taking CS2103T are in the same performance and facing the same situation.

Apologies for not raising this earlier, as I was unaware of the PE timing until recently. The performance is part of a year-long module that I had already completed last semester.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate any guidance you can provide on this.

and when I try to open the addressbook.jar, it shows the following:

<img width="251" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62892e1a-26e6-41fd-b01e-4bba15b573e2" />

I have tried adding lines like:
export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/.sdkman/candidates/java/17.0.11.fx-zulu
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
into vim ~/.zshrc but it does not work. Can anyone help me? Thanks a lot!

For the codingStandard, after I changed the setting is it supposed to be auto-corrected? Currently, it seems it is not. Do we have other methods to make it auto-correct then? (I have already enabled auto-save and have tried exit IntelliJ and then reopen)

Hi prof, no issue doing iP so far and have finished the work so far (because I click the tab to run my java code instead of directly running it in the terminal). And I have followed the instructions in the link.

yes prof I know, but I have tried the above methods, still does not work, everytime I reopen the terminal it still shows sdk version 
zsh: command not found: sdk
(but I used the brew install --cask temurin so at least I can finish the AB3 for now)

I suggest removing the IO redirection test since the app now has a GUI and might no longer needs the IO test.

I've tried commands: todo, deadline, mark, list, event and it worked as intended, also the GUI looks nice 👍

One small problem could be: I saw that in the user guide, you wrote that 
```
Command format:
todo [task name] /by [end date]
```
but I think the `/by [end date]` here is redundant

I think for this one the line from Countable to Readable should be solid line instead of dashed line? As it is an inheritance instead of implementing an interface

Also I think the Document is an abstract class instead of an interface, and the line should be from Document pointing to Readable if I'm not wrong?

Also, I think there needs to be a dashed line showing dependency from `Section` pointing to Handout because in the `capacity` function of Section, it referenced one `Handout` object.

For the association between the `Brochure` and `Handout` class, I drew it as two association lines instead of one (I think based on the description they are two different associations, one being the `handout` being the cover page of the `brochure`, the other being the `handout` is referenced by `brochure`(s)), but I'm not very sure about this.

Is it because the `UiWidget` inherits the `ProgressWatcher`, which implements the `Watcher` interface, while there is an association line from the `Activity` class to the `Watcher` class?

I think yes. And generally an interface can extend another interface (so it is a inheritance), but it cannot implement one iirc.

A very messy CD/OD and sequence diagram but wanted to check if these were correct and if there is any point/mistake I should take note of!
Somethings I wanted to clarify : 

1. Is using composition for the association between Brochure and Handout correct? Since a handout is a part of brochure and would not exist if there was no brochure in the first place.
2. Can the * multiplicity for Handout to Brochure be expressed in the same association (or in this case composition), instead of giving two associations to and from?
3. Wanted to mainly check the sequence diagram since I get confused about that the most :&lt;

Open to any tips and suggestions!

**3. :fas-info-circle: Doubt regarding Tutorial W8**
</div>

I had a doubt in the class diagram (second pic). Why is the multiplicity for rating `0..1`? Since `Rating` is involved in the constructor for `Review`, shouldn't the multiplicity be `1`? And a more general question is, when exactly should we use `0..1` and when should we use `1`? I thought the only distinguishing factor was when they were involved in the constructor.

**4. :fas-info-circle: Questions regarding UML**
</div>

For this code (left side), I feel like the class diagram might be incorrect. The association between `Project and Person`, shouldn't it be a `composition` (similar to the one between Project and Task), because projectMembers cannot exist without the Project existing thus displaying a `whole-part relationship`? As in they wont be "projectMembers" then, just persons.

So I was stuck on how to proceed with getResponse and searched up about which functions enable me to do something I wanted to do (store system.out), and google told me about Print Streams. I did not know what they were so I tried learning from google but could not understand, thus I asked chatgpt to explain the theory and logic behind Print Streams and how to use them in a practical approach. I did not provide my code or the context and just asked it to explain me the logic and theory of Print Streams and ByteArrayOutputStream using examples (like a normal cs lecture!) I have stated that as a comment before the method and have taken screenshots of the chat between me and chatgpt. Is this enough for citation?

And can I go ahead with this concept that I learnt from google/chatgpt, or will it be considered plagiarism?

I add a few tasks and save it in the file, and I can see that the txt file has the content, but on running the application second time, again the list command says there are no tasks, despite the file having tasks. I know that this problem is related to some error that gets shown in the beginning. This started happening after the package increment and I am not able to proceed further because of this. Is there any advice as to how I can resolve this issue?

@Luoq1-Xu But how do we know which constructors we can pass null and which we can't. Because in a lot of other examples involving variables of other classes in `constructor`, the multiplicity is always taken as `0..1`, which is why I thought being present in constructor means automatically the multiplicity will be `0..1`. I am so confused about when to use `1` and when to use `0..1` :,)

@damithc Prof could you please suggest when to use which multiplicity among`1` and `0..1`? :,) Also in the exam if I am assuming something like this (about `constructor` not being able to take `null`), can I just add it in the notes? Or should I add it under my UML diagram in the sheet?

Hi prof @damithc 
1. I have a question regarding the composition from `Handout` to `Section`. Why is it a `composition`? 
2. Also should `Brochure` to `Handout` be a composition too since a `cover page` would not exist `without` the `brochure `and it is a `part of the brochure`?
3. Can the association from `Brochure` to `Handout` be bidirectional instead of two association lines?

Not too sure what caused the error. But my suggestion would also be removing the last few lines of .yml file of I/O tests.

**9. :fas-info-circle: 💡 On using the bye command to close the GUI**
</div>

### Just a sharing on the closing of the GUI

when im trying to keep the bye command(when user input "bye", the application should print bye and close after that.
I tried to use `Platform.exit());` in this package `import javafx.application.Platform;`in my `ExitCommand.java` file

```
package lumi;

import javafx.animation.PauseTransition;
import javafx.application.Platform;
import javafx.util.Duration;

/**
 * Represents a command to exit the application.
 */
public class ExitCommand extends Command ``{``
    @Override

    /*
     * Executes the exit command by saving tasks and displaying a goodbye message.
     *
     * @param tasks The task list to save before exiting.
     * @param ui The UI instance for displaying the goodbye message.
     * @param storage The storage instance to save tasks.
     * @throws LumiException If an error occurs while saving tasks.
     */
    public void execute(TaskList tasks, Ui ui, Storage storage) throws LumiException ``{``
        storage.saveTasks(tasks.getTasks());
        ui.showGoodbye();
        Platform.exit());
    ``}``

    /**
     * Indicates that this command signals program termination.
     *
     * @return ``{``@code true``}``, as this command exits the application.
     */
    @Override
    public boolean isExit() ``{``
        return true;
    ``}``
``}``

```
and I realise this indeed close the application but it will close immediately without showing my `ui.showGoodbye();`
I supposed that the problem is because this command close the window immediately after `ui.showGoodbye()`executed , 
so I tried to delay the execution of the exit by doing` Thread.sleep(100)`

```
    Platform.runLater(() -&gt; ``{``
            try ``{``
                Thread.sleep(500); // Wait 500ms before closing (adjust if needed)
            ``}`` catch (InterruptedException e) ``{``
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            ``}``
            Platform.exit(); // Close JavaFX application after UI update
        ``}``);
```

**but I noticed that this will block the thread for the whole block of code including the ui command.
there is different way that is putting two different threads, one is to handle the ui command , other one handles the exit.

just wang to share another way I find that can delay the exit command 
through PauseTransition**


import javafx.animation.PauseTransition;
import javafx.util.Duration;

PauseTransition delay = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(1));
    delay.setOnFinished(event -&gt; Platform.exit());
    delay.play();




**this is for people who also tried to implement close the application inside the chatbot logic.

open for a while if anyone has other way to implement.**

thank you guys, it suddenly solved yesterday, I will just closed with something I did before it worked so as to provide some information for anyone who encounter this problem.

1.putting content into checkstyle and suppression file resolved one error when trying to load rule file.
2.after saving the checkstyle file, I moved the checkstyle block in the build.gradle from the bottom of the code to just below the plugins block(not sure if this makes a difference)
3.(I think this solved the problem) I restarted the IDE and tried to set again and it worked.

make sure you only upload a .jar file into it, you should upload it at the very bottom of the page ,incase you tried to upload your file in the release message

A question that I had during the PE process was whether the lack of input validation should be considered a bug. The development team of the product that I tested during PE listed the entire input validation—such as checks for hyphens, '@' symbols, slashes, Chinese or Tamil characters—under "Future Enhancements." As a result, their actual validation was minimal yet nothing was wrong about it since I understand that no credit will be rewarded for such reports. They even accounted for potential UI breaks under Future Enhancement. It seemed like almost everything that could potentially lead to a bug was shifted under future work. 

I found this surprising, especially when I know of other teams that took the feedback seriously and implemented proper input validation after PED. It feels a bit unfair if teams that put in the extra effort could still be penalized for minor bugs, while others avoid scrutiny by shifting such feedback to future enhancements. Just wanted to hear thoughts on this and whether there could still be any bugs reported about it. :)

**2. :fas-info-circle: Releasing new jar after PE-D deadline**
</div>

We just realized that while fixing a bug, we accidentally introduced another one that breaks a specific command and we released the JAR without realizing. Since the deadline, 10am has passed and testers might have already downloaded the JAR, we wanted to check if it’s still possible to release a new version in hopes that some of them have not downloaded the JAR.

We understand that it might not not allowed, but it seems like a waste to let them test a command that my team now know is broken in that JAR to be tested.  Hence, asking for any suggestions

Hi, maybe you can try this command:
 
./gradlew clean build

see if it works? Also, maybe check if you followed the following conventions for the packages

A "do within" task is useful if I want to set a deadline task with not only a due date but a starting date. For example, I am tasked to develop a new feature on an existing app, however access to the codebase will only be granted to me next Tuesday. In other words, I cannot begin working on this task _immediately_. An `Event` task implies I will be busy with the that task during the specified "from" and "to" date times, whereas a "do within" task implies more flexibility.

@kumar2215 I notice your approach indeed closes the app window, however the app continues to run in the background. This is evident from Gradle (`./gradlew run`) not exiting even when the window is closed. Instead, my approach does the following:

1. Instantiate a `ScheduledExecutorService` in `Application` child class
2. Inject the instance to the main controller (similar to injecting `Duke` in the JavaFX [tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart4.html#refactor-duke-to-use-fxml)
3. Schedule a one second delay before calling `Platform.exit()`
4. Override `stop()` in the `Application` child class to call `shutdown()` on the `ScheduledExecutorService`

@ChinZJ I experimented with the code, and found a delay of `2000` i.e. 2 seconds does produce the intended result. However, a delay of 1 second demonstrates my point

> I think you could argue that using "as a" here is still fine. "A" and "an" are allomorphs of the same morpheme in English, with "a" being the underlying representation and "an" only being used before vowel sounds. The context of the header should be independent of the rows (since you can have multiple rows, some of which use "a" while others use "an"), so the base form "a" would get used instead.

For Mac/Linux users, check out [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool)

Installation guide from the [README](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool/blob/master/README.md) copied below 👇

You may find xdotool in your distribution packaging:

* Debian and Ubuntu: `apt-get install xdotool`
* Fedora: `dnf install xdotool`
* FreeBSD: `pkg install xdotool`
* macOS: `brew install xdotool` or `sudo port install xdotool`
* OpenSUSE: `zypper install xdotool`

> [!NOTE]
> For Linux users, this tool only works with X11 sessions. Ensure you have X11 session installed for your desktop environment. If you're on Wayland, logout then login with X11.

Here's a script to automate the process

'''bash
xdotool search --name "$1" windowactivate
xdotool key "KP_Tab"

while read -r LINE
do
  xdotool type "$LINE"
  xdotool key "KP_Enter"
done &lt; "$2"
'''

To use it, copy the above to a file `auto.sh`

Next, create a file (in the same directory) with all your commands separated by newlines e.g.

'''
help
list
'''

Name this text file `commands.txt`

Run the script like this `./auto.sh [title] commands.txt` where `title` refers to the title of the window, i.e. the string you passed into `stage.setTitle()` in your JavaFX application entrypoint

OpenJDK does not ship with JavaFX anymore. This is why I stick to Azul FX JDK 17 as it comes with JavaFX.

1. Uninstall the existing OpenJDK
2. Download the deb package for JDK 17 from [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?os=ubuntu&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk#zulu)
3. Run `sudo dpkg -i &lt;path-to-deb-file>` to install

@Zhannyhong  when illustrating code, use a fenced code block instead. Like this

~~~
'''java
public class Main() ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    ``}``
``}``
'''
~~~

renders the following

'''java
public class Main() ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    ``}``
``}``
'''

Assuming that the command is affecting a task, maybe an approach to see whether the task has been affected by the command is a good way to check? 

For example, when running a mark command, a flow inside a test could be like this:
Create task list -&gt; add task to task list -&gt; run mark command -&gt; check if command is marked through assert.

Since the intention of the test is to check whether the command has worked properly, if there are no issues then it would be ok to assume that the command is working and the test covers more lines in your code.

From what I understand, they seem to be associated with the Loan Class.

It's kind of a similar concept in ER diagrams for databases where the Loan Table, where in which case the Loan Class, keeps track of the Student ID and Book ID idea to relate them together along with storing other relevant information.

An advantage of this is that it allows for one to many relationship or many to many relationship, where the one is student and many is the book or vice versa. The relationship handler will be the Loan Class. It also helps clean up the code when implemented at least from what I experienced.

From the screenshot it seems that the gradle is set up properly. 

But just to be sure, are you able to do these things:
- Run your app and do normal commands like list, add, bye, etc. 
- Run JUnit Tests

If you can do those with no problems them your gradle is fine.

Personally, as I start to write bigger programs I notice I lean more towards SLAP. SLAP actually makes it easier to read code compared to not using it, especially when the code base is huge. 

As for the example you've shown about the `exitIfNoarguments` and `exitIfUnacceptableFileName`, the functions does seem short but when new requirements are added in the future it makes it easier to add them in codes with SLAP used rather than without. SLAP just makes the code more scalable compared to not using it, at least from experience. SLAP also allows the method extracted to be used somewhere else for convenience and make the code more DRY.

So personally, I would still use SLAP even though the method or function is short. But in the end, it really is just preference.

Hello, the name of my chatbot is Friday, when I run java -jar Friday.jar on my terminal, nothing happens, the GUI doesn't pop out. I think I'm doing something wrongly. The SDK for my project is azul-17 and my terminal is also azul-17 as shown in the 2 screenshots. I have also copied the jar file in a separate folder while doing the smoke tests.

The launcher code for my GUI is written as the following:

```
package chatbot.gui;

public class Launcher ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        Main.main(args);
    ``}``
``}``
```

When I run the launcher on intelliJ, the GUI does pop out, I don't know why it doesn't when I run  java -jar Friday.jar on my terminal

I just transferred all my data from the old laptop to the new laptop. It was a complete 100% transfer so I didn't have to copy the folder or clone the fork. 

Could it be that the original gradle i downloaded only support intel chip mac and not apple chip mac? But i don't really know how to check this or change the gradle version to suit my new laptop.

I think I managed to solve the problem, I cloned my fork to a new location and open it in IntelliJ as a new project, and i change the project structure to a new java version for my mac as shown in the screenshot, now my code and the gui now both works 

Can I just double check with you prof that I my project structure as shown in the screenshot below is correct and my terminal is also using the correct java version as shown in the code below?

```
openjdk version "17.0.14" 2025-01-21 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.56+15-CA (build 17.0.14+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu17.56+15-CA (build 17.0.14+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)

> 
> [@Nova1729](https://github.com/Nova1729) Yes, if you merged the PR in your fork (or merged it locally and pushed to your fork) and then un-merged it locally, you need to do a force-push to overwrite the merge that is still there in the fork.
> 
> Do be careful in force-pushing though, as it overwrites history. Do be VERY careful in force-pushing to the team repo, as you could end up overwriting other team members' work. Force-pushing to your own individual fork of the team repo should be relatively less risky, as you will only be overwriting your own work.

OK I will be more careful in the future. Thank you so much prof!

There may be several versions of Git installed on your computer.

1. Git bundled with Sourcetree - only accessible within Sourcetree unless you add the directory to PATH.

2. Standalone Git for Windows - only accessible within Git Bash unless you choose this option during installation to add Git to PATH, or add the directory to PATH manually afterwards.

I personally prefer connecting to GitHub through SSH as it is not tied to a specific app like Sourcetree. If you've taken CS2030S, you would've already set up SSH with GitHub, or at least learnt how to.

If this appeared in a real world project and the team takes 5 minutes to apply a simple fix, I think the severity is very low.

However, if the issue remains unfixed for months or years, more people would be affected, and it may also indicate that the team does not care about the project. In this case, the severity may be upgraded to low.

In the context of CS2103 grading, I am not too sure.

Hello! While writing my user guide, I tried to add a table for the command summary in the README.md as follows:
```
## Command Summary
| Command                | Format                                                          |

| Add task with deadline | `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM`                     |
| Add event              | `event DESCRIPTION /from DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM /to DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM` |
| List                   | `list`                                                          |
| Find                   | `find SEARCH_KEY`                                               |
| Mark as completed      | `mark INDEX`                                                    |
| Mark as uncompleted    | `unmark INDEX`                                                  |
| Delete                 | `delete INDEX`                                                  |
| Check for duplicates   | `check duplicates`                                              |
| Remove duplicates      | `remove duplicates`                                             |
```

The file preview renders the table correctly (as shown in the screenshot below). 
<img width="783" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d7c10b8-80eb-4269-a19e-c208f6915d51" />

<img width="1000" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ddd8e3e-d7c8-48d6-9db0-4126fcbf27ad" />

The relevant links are:
- GitHub preview page: https://github.com/ambertan77/ip/tree/A-Release/docs
- GitHub page generated: https://ambertan77.github.io/ip/

@twhjames Can I check how does the tasks.txt file look like for you? (Ignore the data.txt, I think I made a typo in the String returned by the chatbot) I tried using starting the .jar file after deleting all items in the list and it works as it should for me. 

Update: I have made the necessary fixes, and have updated the link to the new jar file [here.](https://github.com/ambertan77/ip/releases/tag/A-Release) Does it work now? Thank you so much for all the help you have rendered so far!

@damithc Hi Prof, can I also check if I have uploaded multiple releases (for the different jar files created after bugs have been found and fixed), would tagging the latest release as A-Release suffice? Or should the older releases be deleted and only the stable release be kept?

@damithc Does this mean that in v1.5, we are still allowed to make functional code changes? For example, if in v1.4, a new feature to like certain contacts is added, then in v1.5, we can extend the feature to unlike contacts? Or should v1.5 be reserved solely for testing and making sure all current features work as they are supposed to?

I think it would be good if you can move your IP project over to a local machine and run your gradle project on an IDE ( IntelliJ is most recommended for Java Programs in my opinion ).

In case the SOC cluster were to be down for some apparent reason in future, at least you can still run your project smoothly on your IDE for future IP and TP tasks.

Hope this helps &hat;

> I'm guessing it's probably not installed since it doesn't appear in the Start menu. I'm not sure exactly how the installation works with Sourcetree, since I already had Git on my laptop previously, but you might want to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) (which includes Git Bash).

Alternatively, you could just [develop in WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) instead, since that gets you a full Linux environment, and Git will already be installed. [IntelliJ also works out of the box with WSL](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html).

Accessing the command line in WSL is also easy if you're using Windows Terminal, just click the drop-down arrow next to the new tab button and click the Linux distro you have installed (typically Ubuntu).

Just gonna +1 on the suggestions here to use relative paths, instead of re-stating how to do it. Since the iP is being packaged as a `.jar` file anyways, it can be run from any location, even from portable drives - so there's no guarantee that your program will even stay on the _same_ computer from run-to-run. Much better to just include it with the rest of the project files.

That being said, if you _did_ want to put your data file in the OS equivalent of `%APPDATA%` on Windows, it's theoretically doable. You'd need to:

1. Get the name of the current OS with `System.getProperty("os.name")`.
2. Get the user's full home directory path with `System.getProperty("user.home")`.
3. Branch based on the OS you've detected:
  a. Windows: get the full path of `%APPDATA%` by doing `System.getenv("APPDATA")`, and creating a subdirectory with your app's name
  b. macOS: Append `/Library/Application Support/app-name` to the user's full home directory
  c. Linux: It's a giant mess with no real standards, but the latest convention is `$HOME/.config/app-name`, so similar to macOS, append `/.config/app-name` to the user's home directory.

It's a lot more hassle, not quite worth it in my opinion.

+1 on the suggestions to move over to a local machine. Looks like you're using a Windows machine (can tell from the font), so [developing in WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment) would be my recommendation for an easier time managing dependencies. [IntelliJ has built-in support for WSL too](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html#open-a-project-in-wsl).

If, for whatever reason, you still want to use the SoC compute cluster, you can probably write a Slurm batch job to run your builds. Those are given more leeway in terms of compute resources than an ad-hoc interactive session via `srun`. The [SoC wiki has a decent guide](https://dochub.comp.nus.edu.sg/cf/guides/compute-cluster/slurm-quick) on how to get started, but you can always ask the Internet or your friendly neighbourhood LLM on more instructions.

And for whatever reason, if you wanted to do even _more_ configuration, look into developing within a Docker devcontainer too, which would allow you to work in the same environment across multiple different computers. JetBrains [has some official documentation on how to get started](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/dev-containers-starting-page.html). I'm probably going to be adding one config to my iP Soon™, so I could share a config that works afterwards.

> As far as I know, we can only read data from `.jar` file , but cannot write data into it. So I think the only way to store data is using OS `APPDATA`, am I right?

Nope, you can write to anywhere on the filesystem, so long as the user running the program has the required permissions to do so! This means that you can write your data to a file in a location specified _relative to where the user stored the program at_.

So, if the user stored it in `~/Downloads/appname.jar`, and you specified a relative path of `./data/foo.txt`, the program would read from and write to `~/Downloads/data/foo.txt`. And if they launched it from `~/Desktop/bar/baz/appname.jar`, the program would read from/write to `~/Desktop/bar/baz/data/foo.txt`.

@jhwan0707 you're trying to authenticate to GitHub with your GitHub password, which has been deprecated and is no longer allowed. You need to set up a specific _personal access token_ and use *that* as the "password" to authenticate.

[Follow this guide on how to create one.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

I've taken a peek at your code, and you're not really using relative paths in the right way:

'''java
// ip/src/main/java/duke/component/Storage.java
private final String READ_FILE_PATH = "../../../data/list.txt";
private final String WRITE_FILE_PATH = "../../../data/list.txt";
'''


Relative paths specify a path to take _starting at the directory where the executable is located_. So, if the user stored your `.jar` file in `~/Downloads/appname.jar`, and you specified a relative path of `./data/foo.txt`, the program would read from and write to `~/Downloads/data/foo.txt`. And if they stored it in `~/Desktop/bar/baz/appname.jar`, the program would read from/write to `~/Desktop/bar/baz/data/foo.txt`. Right now, you're specifying a relative path of `parent directory 3/parent directory 2/parent directory 1/data/list.txt`, which will completely break if, for example, the user stores your `.jar` file in `/home/zechary28`.

With a bit of code, you can then ensure that you're always creating a directory with a certain name, and writing a file to that directory. You're free to store the save file wherever you want - you can decide to have it in a fixed location, or have it in a location that's relative to the executable. I'd recommend the latter approach.

I'm interpreting it like this:

`Event` tasks are items which occur _continuously, throughout_ the specified time duration. For example, "Event: Global Geopolitical Destruction Conference 2025 (sponsored by Palantir), from 6 Feb to 8 Feb". Marking this task as "done" thus only really makes sense _after 8 Feb_ (unless you leave the conference early).

Meanwhile, `DoWithin` tasks are items which occur _once_, but _anytime within_ the specified time duration. So, for example, "DoWithin: Hack the GGDC, between 6 Feb to 8 Feb". So, marking this task as "done" would make sense any time between 6 Feb and 8 Feb, but not any time other than that.

If you extend the functionality further, you could prevent `Event` tasks from being marked as done until their duration is completed, add location tagging info, add reminders, etc. Meanwhile, extended functionality for `DoWithin` tasks could be automatically marking as missed.

You could use this as a chance to perform some logging (i.e. write a record of the error that occurred to a log file, or just straight to `stderr`).

You can click into each CI run to see why it's failing. 

<img width="1728" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6524ef4a-95c0-4ceb-8d74-e16d9ac1103d" />

if you look at [one of your latest runs](https://github.com/Bryce-3D/samplerepo-things/actions/runs/13191230648), you'll see that it's being marked as failed because you haven't defined a `jobs` section in your CI `.yml` file, so it's failing to find any jobs to run at all - that's an automatic failure.

When you created the PAT for SourceTree, did you ensure to enable the `workflow` option to give that PAT permission to add workflow files?

<img width="826" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa34947f-5ae6-406a-8ca4-a77c1f20aaf7" />

If you didn't, then you'll need to create a new PAT with workflow permissions, and give that to SourceTree.

> I mentioned above that I used option 2 rather than option 1, so I didn't use the PAT. I used the other login method listed under option 2 [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html), and as mentioned in my previous issue, option 1 would not work.

Ah, I missed that bit. Personally I'm not bothering with Sourcetree, I use SSH to authenticate and mostly do command-line or IntelliJ's built in Git GUI.

[I spent entirely way too long doing this writeup on the wide range of models and LLM tools that I've tried, but hey, if y'all are interested in that, feel free to dive in.](https://github.com/itsvari/ip/blob/master/AI.md)

But the TL;DR: I've used a _lot_ of models and tools, and I think LLMs are best suited for rubber duck debugging/code review and writing boilerplate, and not as full-on replacements for writing code yourself. In my opinion, the best models as of mid-Feb 2025 are `Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking`, `Gemini 2.0 Pro`, and `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`. For tools and providers, I like [Zed](https://zed.dev/) for its features (especially prompt libraries), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for its generous rate limits. IntelliJ's AI features are half-baked, and using the web interfaces adds too much friction. Running LLMs locally isn't quite meeting my own (admittedly high) standards just yet, but YMMV.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Queries on drawing UML for Action, Task, History practice example**
</div>

<img width="1241" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cccdd7a-fe18-448a-97ec-4a3fcc8f345f" />

Some questions I have from the recommended class diagram answer:
1. What's the difference between a and b:
- a. Why is the arrow from ActionFactory to History not a dependency (dashed) line instead, since ActionFactory does not store, but only refer (by adding ActionX and ActionY) to History in some other ways? (Edit: It is because of the add method inside of History, and thus ActionFactory just has a field referring to History?)
- b. Related to question a, I understand because ActionFactory creates ActionX and ActionY and not store them, that's why the reference to them are dependency lines, then shouldn't a and b be the same?

2. The comment for `List<Task> tasks` suggests the multiplicity to be at least 1. Does comments (part of the code, but more ambiguous) also influence the depiction of the UML, since without it, the multiplicity would be * instead?
- is 0..* the same as *?

Thank you

**4. :fas-info-circle: Enquiries about tP constraints and requirements**
</div>

Hello, I would like to clarify on the expectations on the tP. 

Is it fine for our tP to be a not-fully complete one, where full functionality is limited because of the constraints due to single-user etc.,
or we must have a complete project with full functionality within the scope of such constraints?

- Tested on MacOS Sequoia
- Common unrecognised commands have usual bot reply feedback (good!)
- When there's nothing in the task list, list should list returned be a customised one? e.g. There are no tasks in your list currently.
- Valid commands but without specification task descriptions have same replies as unrecognised commands, should the bot reply be more specific to tell the user it is valid? e.g. Input todo with task description (todo go eat)

Hi, just sharing my take on this.

I think one of the first considerations would be whether it would provide consistent formatting for the whole team. If it's an outlier, then it's probably a suggestion that could be argued against with consistency. 

As you pointed out on communication, I would personally ask the code-owner first to validate my proposed change and if they are okay with it. The case is that there might be planned enhancements where the formatting logic might change, and if the code is not consistent, there could be confusion from inconsistency or bugs. If they don't get back to me after awhile, I would probably not touch the code as it's their work and we need to respect that, and we are under time constraint which changes the game a little here.

On the bigger picture though, 
I still agree that coming together with the team to discuss whether the change would be better for the whole application. But as we are under specific constraints currently under feature freeze, we need to weigh the pros and cons of changing everything for better formatting, if that's the agreed case. 
Otherwise, it's recommended to find some other ways to minimise workload e.g. in terms of UserGuide/DeveloperGuide section notes, through other alternatives that could best mitigate the issue. 

Do let me know if I don't make sense, it's a topic I would like more insights into as well, thanks!

Thanks for sharing, just a subtle spot - does call of Logic()  to `:Logic` return theOne or perhaps nothing? Referring to https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/624, it is best not to assume anything not stated in the UML description. 

I may be missing out on context because I'm just referring to whatever is in this issue

Here's the example Use Case below, should the extension be indexed as `1a` or `2a`? Because I see it as a extension of what happens after Step 1, but it appears that it could also be seen as Step 2 fails, therefore extension `2a` occurs.

**Use case: UC04 - List all students**

**MSS**
1. User requests to list all students records.
2. TutorSynch displays the full list of students with their information.

   Use case ends.

**3. :fas-info-circle: 💡Avoid setting max height for Stage (MacOS GUI Bug)**
</div>

If you're experiencing GUI clipping of elements as shown below, but only on certain smoke test or OS environment, ensure that you did not perform any `stage.setMaxHeight()` or in general any stage set height function in the Java files, and instead use the FXML to configure it.

I believe that is because Windows and MacOS calculates "height" differently from one another; MacOS might actually calculate "height" as the height of the entire window while Windows calculate it as the height of the content of the window instead. (Just a theory though)

**4. :fas-info-circle: Problem with MacOS running my JAR file**
</div>

## Help Request Information (This issue thread is a mix of smoke-testing AND help request for previous issues listed below)
* Development Environment: MacOS
* Compiled initially on my end with SDK azul-17
* Download the **latest release** [here](https://github.com/Shamanbenny/ip/releases/download/A-Jar-5/nightcoder.jar) (Version 0.5)
* The error was brought to attention [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/268) by @alexandtheoh

## How to get started with testing:
1. Ensure that there is no runtime error when running the application in the **latest release**.
2. Test and make sure that the GUI visual bug mentioned in [issue #242](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/242) is no longer present in the **latest release**.

## Current troubleshooting speculation:
1. The JAR file appears to run on macOS as initially seen [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/242), and upon reverting from using AtlantaFX due to some visual bug, by removing the relevant `build.gradle` implementation and any imports from AtlantaFX, I am now being told of this potential error.
2. My current `build.gradle` is:
```
dependencies ``{``
    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.7'
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
``}``
```
3. ~~It could also be that the issue was present BEFORE said AtlantaFX changes, and so I'd like for people who have MacOS to try and use `java -jar nightcoder.jar` on this [release](https://github.com/Shamanbenny/ip/releases/download/A-Jar-3/nightcoder.jar) if possible, as this might help prove/disprove this speculation.~~

## Notes on Edits:
1. I've added the download link for the **latest release** JAR file.
2. I've also added an agenda list for new users trying to help test and provide solution/reasoning to some of the errors previously encountered.
3. I've decided to cross out the call to test for runtime error on older versions (See point 3 of Current troubleshooting speculation), to avoid any unnecessary confusion.

Thanks everyone for your input!

From everyone's input, I've come up with the following stance for myself:

As @Jovin-Ang @codebreaker64 and @TheEnd-alr-taken mentioned, I agree that the use of `final` doesn't necessarily entail the immutability of a variable.
But I also agree with the insight @meloppeitreet provided regarding a **non-static** `final` variable being deemed as a constant variable.
As such, I believe a better response to the question we might want to consider would be that, a variable is deemed a **constant** if it is (bare minimum) a `final` **primitive** variable (in the context of Java), or more specifically, not a pointer (like an object or array).

With this interpretation, whether something is an instance-level variable (non-static) or class-level variable (static), can still be considered a constant variable given the above mentioned constraints.

Let me know what you guys think with this interpretation.

Everything seems to work as intended, and the use of strict dates ensure empty `/from`, `/to` or `/by`. Maybe check to prevent empty string in `/des`? Otherwise, everything seems to work just fine!

The use of a static final String MESSAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET seems like a valid and intuitive approach. 

Alternatively, you could consider having a static final String in Messages.java? 

You could find an example of both in `EditCommand.java`:
```
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException ``{``
        requireNonNull(model);
        List<Person> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) ``{``
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        ``}``

        Person personToEdit = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
        Person editedPerson = createEditedPerson(personToEdit, editPersonDescriptor);

        if (!personToEdit.isSamePerson(editedPerson) && model.hasPerson(editedPerson)) ``{``
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
        ``}``

A more technically challenging solution might be to use nektos/Act to set up the Github CI locally.

**2. :fas-info-circle: FXML vs. Programmatic UI**
</div>

I’m using FXML for my UI layout, it makes the structure more readable and keeps the UI separate from the logic, which I find quite convenient. However, I’ve noticed that some developers prefer to build their UI directly in Java code instead of using FXML.

I was wondering what are the key advantages and trade-offs between these two approaches? Are there situations where using pure Java code is actually better than FXML? Or is FXML generally the recommended way to go?

For example, instead of defining a button in FXML like this:
'''xml
&lt;Button text="Click Me" onAction="#handleClick"/>
'''

They might do it programmatically in Java like this:
'''java
Button button = new Button("Click Me");
button.setOnAction(e -&gt; handleClick());
root.getChildren().add(button);
'''

Just to clarify, for our team project, are we required to strictly use FXML for the UI layout, or is there some flexibility to program the UI entirely in Java code? Also, would it be acceptable to use JFoenix for Material Design components directly in Java code, or are there any guidelines or restrictions we should follow?

Also, to clarify, when, merging to the org's repo, am I supposed to merge on my fork first and then submit a PR?

**5. :fas-info-circle: How should I approach JUnits for return type void methods?**
</div>

<h2>Current Implementations</h2>

<img width="515" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3706b41f-4d96-490a-9b65-22e34ce462ad" />

I implemented the stretch goals of A-MoreOOP, because of that, all my commands are a subtype of an interface "Command". In that interface, there is only 1 method which is a public void class called execute (Sorry if this is not the optimal way to do things). In my entire project there is only 1 method that returns anything, which is the parse method in my Parser class that returns a Command object.

<img width="401" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0741d272-fc9e-45e9-b00a-b1e3cc8e7c94" />

<img width="314" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f7e433b-91ff-4b53-b459-76b9300d24e3" />

The main issue is that using assertEquals requires a value, but since most of my methods return nothing, I am not sure how I should approach this. I could also add a toString method in the command class, but I feel like it's pointless as it is not actually testing whether the commands work, but rather if my parser parses the command properly...

Hi guys thank you so much, everything builds well now. I am honestly not sure the reason but as per the comments, here is what I tried:

1. Download Java 17 from: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html instead of using corretto
2. Use the inbuild gradle tool instead of using terminal ".\gradlew clean build" (Seems obvious now... my bad)
3. Ensure Gradle JVM is actually correct
4. Reclone the project

> [@ShiJianXi](https://github.com/ShiJianXi) Some things to try:

> 
> Also, try using Adobe Acrobat Reader to the exam attachment copy (provided in Canvas/files/handouts) to ensure that the PDF file is searchable in your computer, outside of Examplify. This reduces the possibility that the incompatibility is between this specific PDF file and your specific Acrobat Reader version.

> Set up an appointment with CIT so that you can go there and troubleshoot together. Otherwise it will take a long time to troubleshoot over email. Once the issue is acknowledged by CIT as 'not solvable' (many courses have been using Examplify in lockdown mode without any problem; naturally, CIT is under the impression that there is no such issue), it becomes justifiable for us to change the exam mode to cheat sheet. Otherwise a late change is not fair to those who already checked the compatibility early and are now preparing for the previously announced mode of the exam.

Tried clean reinstall. Same issue
Also tried using Adobe Acrobat Reader to open and search the exam attachment copy without examplify and it works perfectly fine.

Only able to check with CIT next week due to PH and weekend

> [@ShiJianXi](https://github.com/ShiJianXi) [@zacklow28](https://github.com/zacklow28) [@gekjunxu](https://github.com/gekjunxu) and others, In order to narrow down the reason why the PDF search works for some but not for others, I've posted another Examplify assessment named `PDF attachment test - other PDF` (password `Hello123`). This one contains a different PDF file. Please check if the search function works for this PDF. TIA for helping to troubleshoot this issue.

Tested using Windows 11, Up to date version of examplify.
The PDF attachment test - other PDF works fine. The search is almost instant from my side

> [@ShiJianXi](https://github.com/ShiJianXi) I don't think this is specifically mentioned in the coding standard. In either case, we will not be testing white-space issues in the coding-standard questions, as they are not that easy to detect by the naked eye.

Hi is something like this what you are looking for? You can write it this way:
`interface "Comparator" as Comparator <<Client>>`

and it will look something like this:
<img width="143" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04eb26fa-ea38-4493-84c4-fda89f308cab" />

Then afterwards to link this Comparator<Client> component to another component, you can write it this way in your puml:
`"Comparator" --> SomeComponent`

Yep did you guys close all your issues and PRs related to the milestone, but forget to close the milestone itself? Maybe can ask the prof or your TA to take a look, and explain that you guys just forgot to close the milestone, which honestly is a mistake that anyone could make imo.

Hi bro! Think maybe you are just having an issue with local testing of the Developer Guide, there doesn't seem to be a problem on the live site. 

If you check the right panel of your repo, you will be able to see the all past deployments of your TeamScape page. When you click on the most recent deployment you will then be navigated to this page: https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/deployments/github-pages

On this page, you can click on your deployment link which is: https://ay2425s2-cs2103-f09-4.github.io/tp/

If you check the Dev Guide section, you are able to view all the puml files:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1630ae4e-58f1-4a1f-a178-faac05b5dfdc)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb566d70-7998-49c8-8c05-a3e3710d1567)

The team thinks this should be a bug of `severity.VeryLow`, however I argue that this should be a bug of `severity.Low` since this is not purely a cosmetic issue - the incorrect formatting changes the layout of the use case in a way that puts text on incorrect lines.

What do you all think? Should this be a bug of `severity.VeryLow` or `severity.Low`?

Yeah, I would recommend keeping the Gradle JVM version as "Project SDK". This ensures that the JVM the local Gradle installation is always in sync with your project JVM, so you only have to manage one JVM version setting.

Hi, I encountered this error too, you could try adding a Launcher class that calls your main class instead, and adjust your build.gradle accordingly

I encountered this same issue before and this is what worked for me!

An example of how I did it is below: 
package duke;

import javafx.application.Application;

public class Launcher ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        assert args != null : "Application arguments should not be null";
        Application.launch(Main.class, args);
    ``}``
``}``

I was looking at the participation dashboard for Week 2, and noticed that the percentage of answers for Canvas quiz is more than 100%. I wanted to clarify if it is a display bug? Thank you!

`Q Canvas Quiz(zes): percentage of correct answers: **125%** (2/3 points) (after factoring in bonus questions, if any) (within early-submission window? No)`

I encountered the same issue previously, tags were on the local sourcetree but not appearing on Github.

Make sure to select `Push all tags` in the bottom left.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4c97f8d-401a-4250-83d6-61cf2cdb2c1d)

If it works, you should be able to see the tags similar to the image below.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/687c8442-6125-4e85-85c7-da6eb6a65e30)

You can then click on the `tags` button to ensure it is pushed.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Can a composition and a bidirectional navigability be compatible?**
</div>

While working on the `Action`, `Task`, `History` practice example, I became to wonder: what if the type of the `owner` field in the `Task` class were `Action`, instead of `Repeatable`?

<img width="1512" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42dfed1a-2464-4fad-b299-c45a79b5e822" />

If that were the case, the relationship between the `Task` and `Action` would become bidirectional. However, since this association is also a composition, we might need to use the ◆ symbol, which makes it impossible to add the arrowhead (from `Task` to `Action`).

Does this mean we would need to resign either navigability or composition?

For this association class Lesson, are we allowed to
1. add the multiplicities with TrainableBot and Human (assume it is clear that a TrainableBot can be trained by only one Human), or
2. replace the association label 'trained by' with two association roles 'trainer' and 'trainee'?

I am unsure if there exists any notation rule prohibiting them, so I would appreciate it if someone (possibly prof) could provide a clarification.

For the first question, I believe you are correct. The key difference between a and b is that, in order to call `h.add(a)` (where `h` is an instance of `History` and `a` is an instance of either `ActionX` or `ActionY`), the caller needs to have a reference to `h`, but does not need to have a reference to `a`. Therefore, we are allowed not to store the instances of `ActionX` and `ActionY`, while we are forced to maintain the field for `History`.

This is a sort of behind-the-scenes story that we *assume*. FYI, we might assume other scenarios—such as creating `h` inside the method and returning it—but I suppose this is not a good idea, given the intended functionality of `History`.

For the second question, I also believe you are correct. My understanding is that the purpose of a UML diagram is to capture the intention of programmer, and thus, the comment will serve as a strong justification for why we set the multiplicity to `1..*`. For instance, by doing so, we can pay extra attention to maintain this multiplicity when coding.

I personally think `0..*` is equivalent to `*`, but this one I need someone to clarify as well :)

I hope I could help to clarify your doubt, and please feel free to correct me if I am wrong 👍️

Thank you very much for the clarification! I had thought that the entire `◆-` symbol represented composition. When hand-drawing UML diagrams, I would use `◆←` to avoid confusion, although it's interesting to learn that we can use a line without arrowheads to indicate a bidirectional association!

To qualify for full marks, your last 5 iP commits need to comply with [our convention for Git commit message subject](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/standardsAndConventions.html). If you forgot to do this, add more commits with some small tweaks to the code until you satisfy this requirement, in order to satisfy this requirement (Reason: doing so will help you remember this convention better in the tP, hopefully).

Except for the merge commit for the PR

**5. :fas-info-circle: What are the internal methods naming conventions?**
</div>

For Task class, I have
'''java
    protected String toMarkdownStringInternal(String details) ``{``
        return "- [" + this.getStatusIcon() + "] " + details;
    ``}``

    public String toMarkdownString() ``{``
        return toMarkdownStringInternal(this.description);
    ``}``
'''

So for the subclasses like Deadline class, I use
'''java
    @Override
    protected String toMarkdownStringInternal(String details) ``{``
        return super.toMarkdownStringInternal("D: " + details);
    ``}``

    @Override
    public String toMarkdownString() ``{``
        return this.toMarkdownStringInternal(this.description + " (by: " + this.by + ")");
    ``}``
'''

So I have two questions (but the main focus is primarily on the first one, second one is just out of curiosity):

1. So in Python, I use a lot of internal methods, but usually internal methods start with _ for clarity. I couldn't really find references on naming convention for internal methods on the doc, I assume the reliance is on the protected keyword to identify it, but because the purpose is used for the toMarkdownString, I simply just add "Internal", would this make sense?
 
2. What is the general consensus on internal methods especially with regards to open source Java projects since we are going to be working on one for this module (not really exposed to the Java ecosystem, my brain too tuned to the Python/JS/TS ecosystem).

**6. :fas-info-circle: What if I accidentally add the wrong tag, and only spot it after deadline**
</div>

I accidentally labelled Level-5 as A-Exception, mistook the additional drop-down header as the label instead of the main drop-down. If I were to label it Level-5 now, would the system still reflect accordingly? Cause the commit is still dated before the deadline. Or do I need to contact course email for support?

**1. :fas-info-circle: tP Team Repo Setup for Codecov**

I am setting up codecov for my team repo. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/008b0720-dd60-4a33-b5ab-b3d9f47e140a)

According to this instruction, if I go to my repo, I can re-run my **most recent CI run.** However, there is **no run available**. I assume it is because I just forked the repo and have yet made any push or pull request since according to yml file, the workflow only runs `on: [push, pull_request]`.

So, I made a tiny edit `fail_ci_if_error: false` in `gradle.yml` and pushed my commit so that my Java CI runs. Is this the correct way to go about?

hello! i used stubs in my tests for classes like Storage to ensure consistent results. it helps me avoid side effects like my file load/ save in Storage class. for example in my DeadlineCommandTest, i created a StorageStub that overrides save() method in Storage. so, i can verify a task was saved without actually writing to the file. hope this helps!

you have to fork your tP repo over to your personal GitHub account, then clone the fork to your laptop. make sure you have access to your team repo tP, not just being an organisation member. you should be pushing to a new branch of your fork (not the main tP repo), then create a PR to merge ur branch to your team repo tP `master` branch

**2. :fas-info-circle: Fixing bugs after PE-D, considering feature freeze**
</div>



Considering that feature freeze is in place starting 10am on PE-D day, and that we are supposed to fix bugs after PE-D, wouldn't fixing bugs be considered as violating feature freeze?

I assume that `no more than 10% of the functional code is allowed to be changed during the iteration v1.6` is used for fixing bugs for iteration 1.6. My question then, is:
- ~What is the 10% counted against? Each member's contribution of functional code? Or 10% of total functional code by the group? Or 10% of total lines of code by the whole group?~ (edit: nvm ignore this part, saw that it's for each member).
- Assuming after exhausting the 10% limit, and there still exists bugs that are more than what can be negated in `Planned Enhancements`, is it up to the group to decide whether to violate the 10% limit or to take the hit for bugs found in PE? Or does there exist any workaround, should such a scenario arise?

When resizing the width below the size of the bot chat bubble the text can sometimes disappear.
Also when adding a deadline input without the time it doesn't seem to be able to send successfully, the user might feel that the bot is unresponsive

Experienced this too, asked around, and almost my whole group faced the same issue. 
Already tried the remedy as mentioned in #462 #472.

Tried Examplify 3.8 and 3.7.2, issues persist. Tried lower versions than 3.7.2, but not supported. 

Tried installing and reinstalling Adobe Acrobat as well, nothing works. Sometimes search results will appear after 50s, but at that point its useless. Don't think examplify relies on acrobat for displaying pdf files though, since it still works without any pdf reader installed.  

Given the widespread issue, I think its a `type.FunctionalityBug` with `severity.High` with Examplify, and not an issue with our computers.

For the `other pdf` mock test, it seems to load almost immediately. Tried like 4 times. 

For `textbook only`: 

1st and 2nd try: searched `demeter` : 65s (each try means submitting, uploading, then redownloading again and reopeneing the exam)
3rd try: searched `abstract` : 1m 45s
4th try: seaerched `demeter`: exam timed out. >6min

I suggest others whose textbook only version or the initial one that works on first try to give a couple of tries, it seems to break after trying more than 3 times.

In runtest.bat there is the line ```java -classpath ..\bin Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT```. You can add more tests under it such as ```java -classpath ..\bin Duke < inputSave.txt > ACTUAL_SAVE.TXT```. Your inputSave.txt can just contain your list command.

You can perform comparison using ```FC ACTUAL_SAVE.TXT EXPECTED_SAVE.TXT```, where EXPECTED_SAVE.TXT contains the list of  tasks after your list command.

hii I think its not really important, the black box (which is the default option) just means don't change any tracking, leave it as it is, while checking (the tick), means the local branch will track the remote branch, while unchecked (empty box) means there will be no tracking done at all

**2. :fas-info-circle: Help Regarding File Directories**
</div>

I am using IntelliJ on Windows 11. An issue I encountered while trying to create classes for the tasks was that I could not use the classes in other files in my main file called TaskMaster.java. They needed to be under the same package for example

package main;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TaskMaster ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) throws TaskMasterException ``{``
        String logo = """
....
is the first few lines of TaskMaster.java and for a helper file such as Deadline.java
package main;

public class Deadline extends Task``{``
    protected String by;
...
to get the code to compile I had to shift the files from src/main/java to src/main/java/main for it to work.
Is this allowed? Or will the grading script not detect the changes I make?

I had a doubt @damithc in the sequence diagram an alt block is used for the case where one of the 2 must happen, so in the case of this code if the status is not 2 or 3 neither should happen right?
to model that case i left it as an empty else block, is this allowed?

I dont think we are allowed to have so many conditions in one conditional branch?
maybe try breaking it up like below.

@damithc I had a question, for object diagrams, should we only show those attributes we know the values for?
for example isFull and page, should we omit them or add them? page could be equal to 1? or is it better to omit as not specified?

In case you need it, I had to undo a "fast-forward" merge previously (luckily I realized it right after the merge) and I did it with:

'''bash
git checkout master
git reset --hard HEAD~2 # to make "master" go back to 2 commits before the current commit, I think you can use hash too
git merge branch --no-ff # To merge properly
'''

One advantage I can think of is future-proofing in case we add additional values to the enum.

In the context of our IP, perhaps one may keep all the possible commands in a `Command` enum and the `Parser` class will do a switch case to call different functions according to the `Command` enum.

If we add a new command in `Command` and forget to deal with it in `Parser`, having a `default: throw new CommandNotFoundException()` will let you know what went wrong rather than just being silent and doing nothing when the command is used.

I went and check your github, and I realized you didn't put Launcher class
[https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html](url)

Could you add the Launcher and try it again?

You should have a Launcher class like this:
'''java
package pikachu.ui;

import javafx.application.Application;

public class Launcher ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        Application.launch(Main.class, args);

I made sure to switch to the proper Java version before running `./gradlew clean shadowJar` as running `java -version` gives:
'''bash

OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.56+15-CA (build 17.0.14+7-LTS)

'''


I also tried sending the .jar file to my friend's Windows machine, but he gets a similar error. I believe the error has something to do with the JavaFX libraries being incompatible with my processor, but I might be wrong.

I think it's fine by just adding at least 5 more commits which follow the correct format, this is from the iP - Grading section on the website:

>To qualify for full marks, your last 5 iP commits need to comply with [our convention for Git commit message subject](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/standardsAndConventions.html). If you forgot to do this, add more commits with some small tweaks to the code until you satisfy this requirement, in order to satisfy this requirement (Reason: doing so will help you remember this convention better in the tP, hopefully).

Hi everyone, thank you for the help. Sadly I've tried all the suggestions including checking my configurations and clearing the JavaFX cache and it still doesn't work. The latest code is available [on my fork](https://github.com/AbiHalim/ip) if anyone wants to try building the jar on their machine, it might be a problem with my computer if the configuration is all correct.

For reference, as @Junixm mentioned this is the configuration of my Gradle JVM in IntelliJ:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b22c59aa-c39f-4831-85eb-e5da3c1826d3)

and as @SuhailLoya mentioned this is the SDK version and Language settings for the project:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/993096b0-ab9b-444e-ad9a-6f321cfbdda3)

Hi @lavanyagarg112 , after following your instructions step by step it finally works for me. Thanks so much for the help, I'm still not too sure what I did differently before (this time I ran the terminal directly instead of using the terminal in IntelliJ, or maybe I forgot to navigate the proper folder previously). Thanks once again!

Edit: I think what possibly was the issue was that I built the jar file in IntelliJ which runs on Java 17, but when I went to run the jar from my terminal, my terminal configuration was still on Java 21. I just tested running the jar from a different folder, and it didn't work initially until I had to manually switch to Java 17 in that terminal tab before running.

I'm using MacOS (M1 chip) and the JAR runs good on my machine, the program is able to read the save file after exiting the application. All the best!

Hi @wj200, can you double check if you're using the correct version of Java 17 Azul? I faced a similar issue previously and this fixed it

@wj200 I think Java 17 should be correct, but if you're using a Mac like mine I believe you need the specific Java 17 Azul release outlined [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html), but check [this](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html#programming-language) first

Hi @yjunyeu @NhatMinh0208 @veehz thanks for pointing it out, I think the issue was that I only included the Mac dependencies in JavaFX while I should have included the ones for all operating systems. I've updated the release, can I ask for help smoke testing [this version](https://github.com/AbiHalim/ip/releases/download/A-Release/joni.jar)? Thanks in advance

Tested on KDE neon 6.2 (Linux) with JavaFX runtime 17.0.7.

Text commands seem to work as expected.  However, scrolling through the chat using mouse scroll sometimes doesn't work, necessitating use of the scrollbar. I'm not sure if this is a bug with JavaFX or with the application.

"class file version 65.0" indicates that your compiled code was compiled with Java 21 - you need to ensure that your code is being recompiled with Java 17.

Try adding the following lines to your build.gradle, right after your plugins block 

```
java ``{``

    toolchain ``{``

        languageVersion.set(JavaLanguageVersion.of(17))
    ``}``

``}``
```

this will hopefully force gradle to build with Java 17 instead of 21.

All tested functions work as expected. 

One minor issue - it seems that your jar file creates a save file in src/main/java/data of the directory it is run in. This is not intuitive. The save file should probably be placed in a new data directory instead of being nested deeply.

Smoke test carried out on KDE Neon 6.3 with JavaFX Runtime 17.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea33fa34-d446-4fa6-aac0-bb4a6f982e39)

Functionality is mostly intact - but there are a few bugs to do with parsing and file handling. 

If a malformed event/deadline command is provided (for instance, event Attend Meeting /from 2025-02-22 /to 2025-02-23 1903), unhandled exceptions occur

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86be12b3-fa1e-4103-83a6-12ed712d1bf4)

Unfortunately, these malformed commands are immediately saved to ./data/donk.txt, meaning that subsequent commands like list and sort stop working entirely. Reloading the application doesn't help as the application attempts to load the malformed tasks on startup, mandating that the file be cleared manually. 

The handling of a malformed task creation command is part of the minimal spec of Level-5. I would suggest finding a way to have these errors be caught and handled gracefully, with the cause of the error made clear to the user.

Hi prof, another question regarding tracking of lines of code change. If I touch and modify my other teammates' lines, it seems the tp code dashboard updates it and changes these lines' ownership to under my name, increasing my own functional lines of code number.

Am i right to say that if for example, I have 500 lines of code, then I go and touch 100 lines of other people's code, my functional code becomes 600 and I can change 60 lines instead of 50?

I see this a bit differently. I would not call it a `constant` because putting `final` on instance variables just means it cannot be reassigned. However, the object might still be mutable.

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡VSCode checkstyle configuration tip**
</div>

For those using VSCode who want the "check as you type" thing rather than running `./gradlew checkstyleMain` every time, you might want to follow these steps:

Assuming you already downloaded and placed your `checkstyle.xml` and `suppression.xml` files into the directory `./config/checkstyle/` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle),

1. Install **'Checkstyle for Java'** extension
2. Right-click your `checkstyle.xml` file, select 'Set the Checkstyle Configuration File'
3. Add the following into your `settings.json` file:

'''json
  "java.checkstyle.properties": ``{``
    "config_loc": "$``{``workspaceFolder``}``/config/checkstyle/"
  ``}``
''' 

That 3rd step about `config_loc` is especially important, without which you might face this error⚠:
'''json
``{`` "message":"unable to parse configuration stream",
  "cause":``{``"message":"com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.CheckstyleException: Property $``{``config_loc``}`` has not been set"``}``
``}``
'''

If anyone wishes to correct or add-on to these steps, please go ahead. Thanks!

As far as I know, this is no cause for concern, and is a result of some known module-related problems with JavaFX.

**Operating System**
- Windows 11

**Works as expected:**
- `todo`
- `deadline`
- `event`
- `list`
- `delete`
- `bye`
- `mark`
- `unmark`
- `find`
- invalid inputs are handled gracefully

**Possible issues** 

_these are not strictly OS-related, ignore these if these are expected / known already_

1. No persistence of tasks 
When I close and open the application again, my previously added tasks are gone.

2. `list` command works even with arguments after it

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad3eb978-9692-4f37-b814-0d3ff56ce685)

3. `bye` command successfully closes window. However, if extra arguments are added after it, then the bye message will appear, but window will not self-close.

Maybe because of boundary value analysis? (see [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/testCaseDesign.html#boundary-value-analysis))

E.g. if the EPs are 0-50, 51-100, 101-150, then if we can afford it, we should probably test 0, 25, 50 from the first EP, so that along with the "normal" values, the boundary values are sufficiently tested.

I think
- event-driven: events are _consumed_ by listeners, not executed
- transaction processing: transactions are sent by dispatcher to be _executed_ by transaction executors (see [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/architecture.html#transaction-processing-architectural-style))

For tP I believe both are used
- event-driven is used by JavaFX in the UI (maybe related to the Observer design pattern?)
- transaction processing is used when executing a `Command`

Please correct me if needed!

Since `getInstance()` is a static method, I think we refer to [this](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week6/topics.html#w6-1-modeling-sequence-diagrams)

**1. :fas-info-circle: ListView flickers when a single cell item is selected**
</div>

Hi guys.

I was presented with an unusual bug in which when you pressed on a single cell in ListView, the JavaFX elements inside ListCell will flicker for a moment before returning to normal. The previous selected ListCell also behaves the same when a new cell is selected.

The demonstration video is shown here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KUko-Mm38SnY8QxJ7m-2mYM2RkyF79bi/view?usp=sharing
(The video may be unclear due to the 60fps restriction but the flickering occurs every time a new cell is selected. This occurs both on AB3 and my tP)

When I did some testing in the original AB3 project, I realised it also suffers from the same issue.

I suspect this is similar to this problem that was raised in the OpenJDK forum.
https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8177945

May I ask if anyone has faced similar issues? And if possible, may I ask for a workaround or solution for this?

Description 
ListView in JavaFX flickers when a single ListCell is selected.

Steps to reproduce 
Run the program and click on one of the cell in personListCell, assuming the selectionModel of the listView is not turned off.
(You may also comment out .list-cell:filled:selected``{````}`` inside your css file to make the flickering more obvious) 

Expected 
No flickering

Actual 
Flickering occurs

@damithc unfortunately I have to solve this issue on my project as the flickering is very obvious and will affect product quality, as evident in my video where the bookmark will drift from its position violently.

I believe in order to make the flickering more obvious on your end prof, I suggest comment out .list-cell:filled:selected``{````}`` inside your css file and add a random test image to make the flickering more obvious.

My current solution to this problem is to disable selection on listview entirely using ListView.SelectionModel(null) but this will cause a nullPointerException, though the program will not crash.

@kerktaiheng I followed your advice by reducing the number of files drawn from resources but the flickering still persists. In fact, the flickering also occurs in the original AB3 project in which PersonCard did not use draw any files from resources, but just wasn't as obvious.

@lavanyagarg112 Thank you for assisting. I am using Windows OS. May I confirm if the flickering also never occurred on the original AB3 file, even with the css element disabled?

@iamdiluxedbutcooler Thank you for assistance. I specifically turned off the selection model of listView because of this issue. If you delete that line and click on the list items, you should see the flickering I was mentioning about. (If the project inside your video was taken from master branch in our tp project)

@kerktaiheng thank you for the quick reply. I originally tested this too but the bug still occurs.

I wish I could leave it but if you test on my tp project where if you comment out the following code under PersonListPanel.java in ui -&gt; personlist, run the program and click on any of the list cells, you will see a very obvious flickering happening in my program.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ba976b6-5e70-4797-8484-01151e17c9d8)

Regarding the bug only happening on my device, this is not true as I have confirmed the same bug also happened on other people's devices, including my teammates and @kumar2215 from earlier replies.

@iamdiluxedbutcooler thanks for the reply! Preventing any mouse click event was also what I tested too. Unfortunately doing so will remove the ability to drag the scrollbar inside ListView, which I would like to keep it as a feature (since JavaFX scrolling is kinda wonky at times and my scrollwheel is broken). I do agree though this is a minor problem that probably will not affect much.

Worse comes to worst if the solution was not found, I will be implementing this in my final iteration of the project. I would still like to keep this issue open though, in case anyone faced a similar issue and found a solution.

UPDATE: If you do not intend to create any functionality with ListCell on selection, you can disable ListView's selection handling using the following code:

`personListView.addEventFilter(MouseEvent.MOUSE_PRESSED, event -&gt; event.consume());`

Combining this with `personListView.setSelectionModel(null);` will completely disable selection from ListView while ensuring no NullPointerException will be printed out.

Is it okay to ignore Codecov report, or is it some ways to solve this? It suggested that my codebase does not have enough coverage (some of my classes are very hard to write test cases for, eg: classes that prints text, because the text can change over time).

**Hi, I have a question: How can I dynamically find the file path for a resource in my Java project (e.g., `data/Duke.txt`), without hardcoding the full path or depending on the current working directory?**

I currently have the file path hardcoded in the source code like this: `Documents\Local Computer\CS2103T\Individual Project\ip\data\Duke.txt`. This works as long as the project stays in the same location. However, if I move the entire project to a different location, the hardcoded path breaks, and I need to manually update it, which is not ideal.

I have also tried using `System.getProperty("user.dir")` to dynamically get the current directory path, and then locate `Duke.txt` relative to it. Unfortunately, this approach also fails because the `user.dir` depends on the directory where the program is executed. This causes inconsistent behavior when the program is run from different locations.

Is there a reliable way to dynamically determine and access files (such as `data/Duke.txt`) based on the project structure, regardless of where the program is run from?

As far as I know, we can only read data from `.jar` file , but cannot write data into it. So I think the only way to store data is using OS `APPDATA`, am I right?

The functionalities mentioned above all work as intended, common errors are also handled well.
However, I think you can consider adding error handling for empty user inputs (as shown in the last screenshot, exceptions are thrown, but thankfully it doesn't crash the app and the user can still use it just fine.)

Thanks for the reply! One thing I'm not quite sure is whether this is acceptable as it's different from the textbook. I might be wrong though.

Thank you prof! I managed to solve the problem.
Turns out all I have to do is add the following `skinparam` to make the stereotype (generic) visible.
```
skinparam classStereotypeFontColor RANK_COLOR_T1
```

I understand omission of built-in classes, but what if the purpose of my diagram is to show that a component uses the `Comparator<T>` interface?

### What I Need Help With: 
🔹 How can I properly bundle JavaFX inside the JAR so that it works on Windows & Linux?  
🔹 Are there any **missing dependencies** in `build.gradle`?  
🔹 Should I switch to shadow JAR or use JavaFX SDK instead of Gradle dependencies?  

Would really appreciate any insights or fixes! Thanks in advance! 🙏

Hi everyone,

I have built an updated version of my iP JAR file after fixing cross-platform JavaFX compatibility issues that caused errors in the previous smoke test.

I need help from classmates using **Windows, Linux, and MacOS** to verify that the new JAR file runs smoothly before submitting my final version.

🔹 Instructions to Test:

a. Download the JAR file from my latest GitHub release: (https://github.com/arshinsikka/ip/releases/tag/v0.2-final)

b. Run the following command in the terminal:java -jar shin.jar

c. Check if the chatbot GUI opens correctly and whether task management commands work as expected.

If you encounter errors, please reply here with:
1. Your OS version (e.g., Windows 10, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS Monterey)
2. Your Java version (Run java -version in terminal)
3. The error message/logs shown

Your help is greatly appreciated! 🙌

I'm assuming this allows for flexibility with parsers. Allowing the parsers to have their own internal state and configuration could maybe allow for extended functionality through additional flags etc which could change the behaviour of the parser and the result?

In java the default access modifier is package private. Hence, B, which specifies this, is more accurate than A, since omitting the access modifier in a UML diagram could mean that the access modifiers are NOT actually package private.

Hi, here are some of my thoughts. If anyone deems otherwise, feel free to correct my understanding.

Could you confirm the following?

1. Directory Structure:
   - `src/main/java/Homura/Todo.java`
   - `src/test/java/Homura/TodoTest.java`

2. IntelliJ Settings: "Project Structure > Modules > Sources":
   - `src/main/java` is marked as **Sources**.
   - `src/test/java` is marked as **Test Sources**.

3. Gradle JVM is set to **"Project SDK"** 

Have you tried to invalidate IntelliJ Cache? Apparently it clears outdated indexes or corrupted cache files in IntelliJ, which might be preventing test discovery?

It seems to me that the issue can be either IntelliJ's settings or a package structure mismatch since the test case runs successfully using Gradle. The `build.gradle` configuration file in your `master` branch looks fine to me (apart from the duplicate dependency which would not affect this issue. Do remember to update the `archiveBaseName` in your `shadowJar` configuration for `A-Jar` increment).

Hi Bryan,

You can verify if the `Sources` and `Tests` directories are properly configured by inspecting the `main` and `test` modules in the **Project Structure**:

- **`main`**:
<img width="1074" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/270cf07f-a57e-47e6-af2f-be3fc9652719" />

- **`test`**:
<img width="1070" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/732fe8af-0d74-4610-b764-19eba89c6467" />

If your project structure is correctly configured and you have invalidated IntelliJ’s cache but still face the same error, could it be that you are running `TodoTest` through Gradle with an invalid test configuration?

I was able to replicate your error when I re-structured my test directory and running an individual test via Gradle. As shown in the attached image below,  the issue arises due to an invalid package in the Gradle test configuration. `TaskListTest` is an old test configuration, while my `TaskListTest (1)` is my new test configuration
<img width="1511" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86031181-a3ab-4cac-ae68-0d6dd417c3c3" />

The difference is in the `Run` command.

- **Old `TaskListTest` Configuration**:
  - This configuration fails as the `Run` command points to an invalid package
￼<img width="799" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89134868-bb36-4c05-ae0e-a9ceffa91713" />


- **New `TaskListTest (1)` Configuration**:
  - This configuration works as the `Run` command points to a valid package
<img width="791" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3198e86e-bb04-4c9c-9f32-0633583ee59e" />

Could you check if your `TodoTest` Gradle test configuration has a valid `Run` command? Ensure that the package in the `--tests` argument matches your test class

It removes the project cache files that were built by IntelliJ, and forces the IDE to rebuild them.

You can refer to this documentation - https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/invalidate-caches.html

Hi @ambertan77 ,

I'm using Macbook Pro M2 (MacOS Sequoia version 15.3.1). I seem to be encountering an issue with the `delete` command in your Bob chatbot (as seen in attached screenshot).

<img width="403" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95803141-d2d9-4e9f-9310-0460022fc65c" />

I have reviewed your [delete a specific task user guide](https://ambertan77.github.io/ip/#delete-a-specific-task) and followed the instructions, but the problem persists.

For the sequence diagrams, when do we add an Object Deletion X?

In this case, can I assume that since the Factory object and the Unit objects are associated with the variables `f` and `u` respectively, Java's garbage collector will not reclaim those objects, unless `f` or `u` is set explicitly to `null`?

After adding the test as suggested, there's a `java.util.NoSuchElementException` being thrown every time I run the tests. After searching online, it seems that the issue lies in closing the `Scanner` tied with `System.in`. I tried switching to `BufferedReader` but _problem_ seems to persist. Should I be bothered by this? (doesn't affect the actual logic)

**Output of `runtest.bat`**

Hi @Jensen188 

I tested your JAR file on linux. There is no isssue running. Good job! 

Here are few directions for improvement:

- Upon startup, no welcome or hello message is displayed
- mark (with invalid task index) causes IndexOutOfBoundsException 
- bye command does not exit application, user can continue typing new commands afterwards

I'm quoting this from cs2103T website:

_The distinction between composition (◆) and aggregation (◇) is rather blurred. Martin Fowler’s famous book UML Distilled advocates omitting the aggregation symbol altogether because using it adds more confusion than clarity._

So personally I reckon whether you choose to model it as aggregation or composition is entirely open to interpretation (at the end of the day both just add additional information to a typical association relationship)

and I am also using the correct dependencies. not sure how to fix this honestly. My jar file does contain all my dependencies (ive tried comparing the file size to a file without the dependency and this jar file is much bigger). I tried looking up tutorials as well but they seem outdated? and not really in the scope of this course. Wondering how I can fix this thanks !

Hello! 

I am a bit confused about IP, it shows that I have pushed tags and done all I needed to do but I am not sure if its enough. For example,I only included javadoc for half of my code. How will the teaching team ensure that I have done so? and if I had not done so then am I able to rectify that mistake? is there a way for me to check this automatically or must I go ahead and count my methods? Additionally i am quite confused by week 4 - 5's IP increments. Most of week 6 is optional so where is the minimum I can end at? is it sufficient to have a working CLI and a GUI that only echoes inputs? thank you!

took me a while to figure out the commands.

I think when you add an event it does not verify that the "from date" is before the  "by date". It does not have to be in chronological order in the current implementation 
Overall, LGTM! 

In the future you could consider having a help feature (so i would know about all the features without looking at the documentation), and maybe more specific error messages would help! (eg. what part of the command is wrong)

Secondly, I think you could checking if the value they give for mark/unmark/delete is an integer before you try to access the value. I tried "mark a" and the program crashed.

when i try to add in a command with an extra space between mark   1 , the program crashes. You are currently dealing with leading additional spaces, but if there is an extra space between the command the program seems to crash

not too sure, but when i type in bye, I am unable to close the program! 



other than that! it looks good to me :)

i think you can try changing the version.

You did mention that you used JDK 17 for the rest of your project! 

You can try running the following command to check the Java version Gradle is using in your project:
./gradlew --version

This will show the JVM version Gradle is using. Even if your system’s default Java version (java -version) shows Java 22, Gradle can still use Java 17 for your project.

Since you are using a Gradle toolchain, your project will be built using Java 17, regardless of the system’s Java version. This means when you run:

./gradlew clean shadowJar

your JAR file will be Java 17-compatible, even though your system Java is Java 22.

I am not very sure about this! But this is something I tried before. You can check what JDK version your gradle project is using before you try changing the default version of java

I tried it on windows, with JDK 17.


Overall, LGTM.

In the future, you can consider displaying error messages when you add an invalid format for the deadline and the events, write now the error is only seen on the terminal. The system does not crash, but it would be helpful if the error message is shown.

Also, I think for parsing you could consider trimming additional spaces as it does not recognize it now.

I've realized I made 2 mistakes here,
1. I've added a commit for branch-A-CodeQuality, "Refactor code to improve code quality". However, due to some pull request merging and reverting of commits, it ended up on the master branch. So now my branch-A-CodeQuality only has the changes from syncing with the latest master version, and not "Refactor code to improve code quality" directly. My code works fine with all the additions needed for branch-A-Assertions and branch-A-CodeQuality, just that branch-A-CodeQuality feels redundant now. Can I leave the branch as it is since it still contains the commit?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/044bae65-3ae4-4a15-be28-08808351b7bb)

2. I accidentally merged the pull request from the master branch into branch-A-CodingStandard instead of branch-A-CodeQuality, so I merged branch-A-CodingStandard back into the master branch without any changes.

It seems that i have missed out "Git-Standard". Can anyone point me towards the right direction to what i am supposed to do. Thanks!

My last 5 commits subjects are as follows

1. Fix bugs introduced by Task.java
2. Add FindCommand.java and its relevant codes
3. Merge 'branch-A-CodingStandard'
4. Tweaked codes to comply with coding standard
5. Add java doc

i am thinking that 4 caused this violation due to 'tweaked'.

**Things to check specifically**: OS compatibility as I am only on Mac. Basic commands can be found here (https://github.com/darHH/ip/releases/tag/A-releaseFinal)

**Guide for smoke testers:**

1. Copy the jar file to an empty folder and test it from there. This should surface issues with hard-coded file paths.
2. When running the jar file for smoke testing, instead of double-clicking the jar file, do the following: open a terminal -&gt; navigate to the jar location -&gt; run the java -jar "JAR_FILE_NAME" command.
3. Post screenshots from your smoke tests.
4. Mention which OS you used for testing.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Correcting grey-area bug edited by others**

Let's say you feel like, or someone has reported as a bug, that the formatting of a student is not intuitive enough.
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7574e3f6-79aa-46b2-8980-a31ee1be8575)

And therefore, in your code you write:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8974f13b-6ed0-45cf-b658-149c78663e10) 

Instead of this:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cbaadce-fa4b-440f-9ebd-2395077d1d18)

Now the Ui looks much more intuitive to the user.
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c379ec1-6440-40fd-9007-b0348ca75c15)

But indeed the changed code has more prone to bug, and code expensibility. On the other hand, considering it is a final phase of product and creating/restructuring logics for such formatting may outweight.

I have spotted out such code which was from other programmer, what is the wise approach?
Since the code is from the other programmer, is it respectful to not modify before letting the group know and ask for validation?

This question may seem stupid, but I believe similar situations happen in every team programming projects, and I wanted to hear what others think.

https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3RemovingFields.html

I am not sure how to perform this instruction:

Remove usages of Address by performing Safe Deletes on each entry i.e., double-click on the entry (which takes you to the code in concern, right-click on that entity, and choose Refactor -&gt; Safe delete as before). 

Here, I am not sure what the entry is referring to. If I try to refactor the Address class field from EditPersonDescriptor as instructed, 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6e0f931-ca71-425f-8e37-908ce70d8355)

I still get the safe delete conflict.

Hi prof, thank you for replying me.

It is the case in the example because such `format(person.getName())` is only present in the Command class, while the rests are not. However, assuming that such code were used consistently for all command classes, I am not sure if it is a bug prone code.

If in the later iteration, tthe code changes and the team decides to change the Messages.format(Student) method to simply return `ID: [ID]`, then only that command will display differently. It would be then hard to spot it thus not good for the maintainability.

I had a similar problem (from this issue: https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/52) 

However, the commits I pushed last evening appeared this morning.

From my understanding, perhaps there is an issue with the implementation of the ```equals``` method. This explains why the test case doesn't pass. Consider comparing the instance fields of ```this``` and ```other``` (name, start and end date) in the ```equals``` method!

**2. :fas-info-circle: Regarding tPs MVP**
</div>

We were instructed to limit the MVP to only the essential features, while still building on AB3's existing code. So, if there's a feature in AB3 that's not part of our MVP specification—but that we plan to add in a future version—should we remove that implementation from AB3's codebase during MVP development? 

I am asking because it seems odd to delete it now only to reintroduce it later.

If so, does that mean it is okay to have some extra features in the MVP that were not listed in the MVP specification? (As the MVP specification would contain only the absolutely necessary features which doesn't include the said extra ones)

Hi everyone!

I am working on [A-MoreOOP](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week3/project.html#4-add-increments-a-moreoop-a-packages-a-gradle-a-junit-a-jar) task for iP.

I wanted to get some opinion if I should place the functions of parsing date and time into my Parser class, or in my TimedTask class which is a abstract parent class to Deadline and Event.

This is what my parse functions look like:

''' java
public static LocalDateTime parseDateTime(String date) throws MonaException ``{``
        try ``{``
            return LocalDateTime.parse(date, INPUT_FORMATTER);
        ``}`` catch (DateTimeParseException e) ``{``
            throw new MonaException.InvalidDateFormatException();
        ``}``
    ``}``
     
   public static String formatDateTime(LocalDateTime date) ``{``
        return date.format(OUTPUT_FORMATTER);
    ``}``
'''

I have a few questions regarding the responses to PE bugs 

1. For extreme cases like date being '15-1-9889', would it be considered a valid bug? Since it technically is a valid date and the product does not fail when given such an extreme date.
By extension, what would bug for an extreme case entail? Like in what cases would the extreme values be considered a valid bug

2. For use cases in DG, would it have to contain all the possible commands in the product or the main ones will do (e.g add, delete but not edit) ? As I can forsee the use cases being very long for products that contain many commands

3. For bugs that are 'response.NotInScope', is the justification that it was stated in the UG that it is not supported be good enough?

I am referring to the Use Cases part of the DG, whether we are required to state every one of the commands the product provides as a use case.

Hi i am using MacOS. I followed your user guide and everything seemed working except for the remind function. Please check the screenshot and I am not sure if that is expected.

Also in the terminal it keeps printing "javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader$ValueElement processValue

Hi all I find a workarounds working on my mac. 

- Open the pdf file with preview
- Select file, print and save it as a pdf
- The new pdf can be opened by the adobe reader

However the property and detail information of the pdf file are definitely slightly changed. @damithc Please let me know if this is acceptable in the exam.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1INl1qTX0twLif-jfutlRRcCN-79XX-Cu/view?usp=sharing

Here is the "printed" file for your reference.

Also, with further observation there are random font error and I am not entirely sure if the search function is working as expected.

For me, I would not consider it as a constant variable as the final value is only for that specific DialogBox object that was constructed. So if you got multiple DialogBox object with different final value, it does not feel like the variable is constant at all. Hence, I feel the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE should be use for static final instead as it is constant for all DialogBox Objects.

For context, the tester reported a bug that the app does not allow certain special characters in Names, but this is listed as a planned enhancement in the developer guide.

Should this be labelled `response.Reject` or `response.NotInScope`? From our understanding, anything that has a possibility of being implemented in future should be labelled `response.NotInScope`, which earns the tester some marks without penalising the dev team. But the following guideline regarding Planned Enhancements says that testers will not earn any marks for reporting these as bugs.

OS: macOS

Summary: command such as "deadline return book /by 2/12/2019 1800", "event read /from 2pm /to 4pm" and "event office hours /from Mon 2pm /to 4pm" did not work on my side. Exception handling shows that an event command returns a deadline event formatting instead of an event formatting (as shown below). Tasks get saved after reloading and the other commands such as delete and mark works. 👍 Do let me know the format of your deadline/event command if you need me to test again. 😃

## Problem

SOC allocates limited resources to each session/account due to shared workspace. Therefore, you will hit resource issues from time to time.

**Recommended Solution**

- Run the Gradle build locally
- Migrate the project to your local machine.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Question regarding removing immutability for project models**
</div>


Is it acceptable to remove immutability from project models? We’ve found it very challenging to implement bidirectional navigability through association variables when a model is immutable in our project.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bcf05b1-fff3-4060-b94e-a74835945a31)

Currently, we are working around this by fetching the updated tag from a registry each time we access it through a person. However, with multiple bidirectional associations, maintaining immutability seems increasingly difficult and impractical for our design.

Additionally, we could not find any mention of immutability in the tP grading criteria. We would like to clarify whether it is acceptable to relax this condition.

I think you are not using the Zulu 17 jar. It states it cannot find javafx.application as the root source of issue.

I am not sure if this part is supposed to function this way but I tried undoing a delete task command which will work fine in the app, but after relaunching, the task will not be shown so maybe the undo might not be saved? (e.g. list have task 1. HI, i delete 1 and undo, it will be in list still. But when i reopen app, task 1 will not be shown)  (can refer to picture 3 and 4)

# Smoke test on windows - some unexpected behaviour

### Inputting a space as a description for deadline commands returns no reply (with text input not being cleared after pressing send). Same issue not seen with event.

### Edit: Appears to be an uncaught exception based on terminal outputs, please verify.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/112926a3-7573-45eb-84f9-e484bed6d4eb)

Someone else can check if this is replicable.

### Otherwise, works as expected:

### Task saves after reloading (as before, so did not test as extensively)

Could depend on the intended target group, as you said. It generally isn't that huge an issue especially since Singaporean numbers are up to eight digits only, but allowing international numbers might make a stronger case for allowing spaces.

Giving a low would make it more likely to be accepted as is, most of the time its a relatively minor inconvenience.

### Issue
Java version: `17`
I am using the testFX library to perform unit tests on GUI, but the test fails the CI task for Ubuntu only.
I tried to recreate the issue on a native Ubuntu OS machine but build was fine.
The testFX version that I am currently using is `4.0.18`

### What I've tried

- I tried to include `System.setProperty("jdk.gtk.version", "3");` to force the system to use a specific version of gtk
- I also tried to install `libgtk` with the CI task:
  ```
  - name: Install libgtk-3-0 for linux
          if: runner.os == 'Linux'
          run: sudo apt install libgtk-3-0

I believe this issue occurred because I made the increments on my fork's master branch and then merged them into the team's TP master branch.

What is the correct workflow to rectify this?

> [@GabriellaGloria](https://github.com/GabriellaGloria) It should be `src\main`, not `src\main\java` (so, fxml and css files are included as well). I've corrected the website accordingly .

Our team thought that code under `/resources/view` is not tracked and has already merged quite a few UI changes under `src/main/resources/view` and additional functional code under` src/main`. Does this mean we need to revert the UI changes if we want to reduce the lines of code? That would be quite a painful process...

Hi all,

I have reported a bug that results in data loss. My steps to reproduce the issue only show how 1 person's data is lost. However there are also ways to cause the entire database to be deleted but i did not provide that in the bug description. 

Should i label it as medium due to the fact that based on the description it only occurs occasionally and causes a slight data loss

1) yes
2) yes
3) no, it could be referenced by something later on in the code but is not captured in this diagram

qns
1) yes the object calling it is not shown
2)  It could be argued that it shows when gee is created so not irrelevant, but there is no functionallity of Gee shown so could be irrelevant
3) I think it is better to remember which are compulsory like the boxes, :class, condition, but another optional one are name of function called + arguments if it does not contribute to better understanding
4) You can draw a smaller box in the bigger box but still ensure that everything that occurs in the smaller box is drawn in the smaller box

**Commands Tested:** bye, list, echo, find, view, todo, deadline, event
**All commands worked. Great Job!!** 😃👍 
**Possible suggestion:** There could be a check done on the event command which checks if the To date is after the From Date. Current Implementation accepts a To Date that is before From Date

Hi, I was wondering for a dedicated function where it adds phone number, if it does not allow spaces in the input, would it be considered a FeatureFlaw with low severity OR FeatureFlaw with medium severity?

As some users, especially older users would find it hard to read numbers in long contiguous order, thus having a space to break up long digits into chunks would enhance user's experience.

I was able to get my project to build correctly with mainClassName, but it seems that [this is deprecated from Gradle 6.7 onwards.](https://docs.gradle.org/6.7/release-notes.html).

Using mainClass.set() will be better considering that support for mainClassName is likely to be eventually dropped.

I can't say I've worked with many Java projects, but the ones I've glimpsed through (usually from hobbyist developers) don't really seem to use any special differentiators for internal methods.

In theory, with JavaDocs providing a clear outline of all the externally accessible components of a class, there shouldn't be a need for others to look at your code to determine which methods they're supposed to use.

Good IDEs will also clearly mark methods by their access modifiers, so glancing at the project structure might be sufficient for your own purposes.

Though, if it helps your own workflow, I suppose it doesn't hurt to use the conventions you've mentioned (provided everyone you're working with is on board).

Prefacing this by saying this is my interpretation of the question; feel free to point out anything you might disagree with (or things I got wrong).

1. Yes, the method call should be aligned to the top of the activation bar of Foo
2. Yes, the arrows are pointing the wrong way
3. Not always. It's not given in the diagram or context whether the Gee object is referenced anywhere (for example, as a field in bar), so whether or not it gets flagged for garbage collection isn't immediately obvious.

As for the extra questions:
1. We're not given any information on what called the Bar constructor, but given the purpose of a Sequence diagram, it should be safe to say that the overall while loop is part of some other class that we're not aware of (i.e. some Main class).
2. The diagram contains only information regarding the while loop, and shows no other interactions with Gee, so yes it's otherwise irrelevant here.
3. Not sure what you mean by optional; if you mean what parts of the diagram could be omitted, the usual suspects as laid out on the website could be left out, like activation bars, irrelevant return values/arrows, the name of the Bar objects created, etc.
4. Why not? Just nest the boxes.

To be more specific, an alt path suggests that the program should execute one of two (or more?) paths within an alt block, while an opt is something the program might skip over entirely. An alt path of just one block doesn't make much sense then.

Regarding Windows' Snipping Tool, just keep in mind the the window screenshot tends to leave a 1px border around the outer edge of the window... which contains whatever was on your screen.

It can look particularly bad on small windows against text or colourful images. (yes that's discord)
If you really want to obsess over these kinds of details, crop them out using some image editor (personally prefer Paint.NET).

I expect if you get this email, you can consider yourself marked complete for watching videos.

EDIT: Of note is the fact that I had watched the videos a few days before getting this email, so I recommend assuming yourself marked complete if you haven't scrubbed the video and watched till the end.

Good day all,

I noticed that in [Level 7](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week3/project.html#3-add-increments-as-branches-level-7-level-8) of Week 3 ip tasks, there was a special emphasis on creating a merge commit, rather than simply taking the default options ([which fast forwards](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#Documentation/git-merge.txt---ff)). I note that the page adequately explains that this is for grading purposes since only merged branches are detected by grading scripts, and for the ip, it is rather unlikely to have concurrent development on `master` branch, resulting in the `git merge` default of fast forward being true for most of us.

Yet, I am still curious if there are any practical scenarios where having a merge commit is _preferred/better_, compared to preserving a linear history whenever possible? Or if this is an arbitrary choice? Links to resources appreciated.

Thanks!

@samuelneo, I essentially went down the same path as you before discovering this post, and can confirm the following.

1. Checkstyle does not distinguish between normal and lambda style expression, [the setting is simply `caseIndent`](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/checks/misc/indentation.html).
2. Faced similar issues when I tried regex and I cannot find any _complete_ solution.
3. The whole "[check format](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/filters/suppressioncommentfilter.html#Properties)", which is basically the rule, needs to be suppressed, and so, it is not possible to only suppress `caseIndent`.

So, I have decided to ignore this check via code comments. The rule name is `Indentation`. This works in Intellij with checkstyle-IDEA plugin, so the errors in Intellij disappear once I type these comments. In my case, it looks like the following:

```
// CHECKSTYLE.OFF: Indentation
return switch (op) ``{``
    case BYE -&gt; parseByeCommand(args);
    case HELP -&gt; parseHelpCommand(args);
    case LIST -&gt; parseListCommand(args);
    ...
``}``;
// CHECKSTYLE.ON: Indentation
```

Assuming it is the latest commit you are interested in changing, check out [`git commit --amend`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---amend). Then, to update (be careful with this!) the remote repo, you would use a force push.

I would do something like the following
```
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
git push --force
```

3. run `source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"`

5. Run the jar file with ` java -jar LeChatBot-1.0.jar`

If you pushed the commit already

 **Rebase the last commit**:
   '''sh
   git rebase -i HEAD~N
   '''
   Replace `N` with the number of commits you want to modify.

In the rebase editor, change `pick` to `reword` for the commit you want to edit, then save and exit.

Modify the commit message when prompted, then save.

Force push the changes:
   '''sh
   git push --force
   '''

However, be careful with `--force`, because it rewrites the history and can cause issues if there are other people using your repo(diverging histories)

If you are still not sure, you can consult [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message)

Hey Bryce,

In this case, the name upstream is just a convention. Using git remote add upstream is just adding another remote repository reference. You could name it anything you want and the workflow would still function the same way.

However git remote add upstream is different from git push --set-upstream where it links your local branch to a remote tracking branch. It’s useful when you create a new branch locally and want to push it to your fork (origin) while tracking it.

**3. :fas-info-circle: Seeking Feedback on File Structure and Code Quality**
</div>


Hi I would like to know and get feedback on my file structure and code for my iP. If anyone could take a look and let me know your thoughts or suggest improvements, I’d really appreciate it.

This is the current structure of my IP
- kaidama.java: Contains the main function, using if-else statements to differentiate tasks to perform.
- todo.java, deadline.java, event.java: Each extends from the Task class to represent specific types of tasks.
- Task.java: The parent class for all task types.
- tasklist.java: Manages an ArrayList of all tasks.
- Response.java: Handles all println statements for output corresponding to tasks or actions.
- KaidamaException.java: Defines custom exceptions for the program.

Are there any issues and improvements I can make?

You can try to store your data under AppData or equivalent, not within the project.

In the end, your end users are not going to get your project structure, but rather a jar file. Hence, it might be a pain for you to run the program via cli and locate the correct _for now_. Once you have the jar file, relative pathing makes more sense to the user.

Yes you can, that's just an arbitrary name, `origin` is also an upstream name FYI.
My personal recommendation: you probably want to choose something simpler like `team`, so that you can type the git commands more easily. E.g. `git rebase team/master`.

Good tip for the rest!

@minhkiwi14 Setting `pull.rebase` to `false` is very similar to `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master`. I don't see any issues from that. 

Personal tip to prevent data losses when you encounter merge conflicts like this: try to backup your local master branch using `git checkout -b backup-master`.

FYI, in other practices (not used in CS2103T because it might incur lost of timestamp), you can also `cherry-pick` the commits that you wish to apply onto the upstream master.

Thank you for the testing! 
Regarding the remind function, may I ask if you ran the app on 17th Feb or 18th Feb? It was written so that it only reminds the tasks for the current date and if you ran it today then the event reminder should not show.

And for the version mismatch warning, I saw it can be ignored on javafx tutorial, but it should be better if I can fix it thanks!.

From an [earlier issue](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/59#event-16059969008) raised, I didn't realise that the Week 3 project instructions were mistakenly filled with Week 5 instructions due to a bug involving a misplaced `</div>` element. As such, I performed a Merge Pull Request from `branch-Level-8` instead of directly merging `branch-Level-8` with the `master` branch for my `Level-8` Increment. Will this difference in merging cause any problems with the grading scripts not being able to detect the changes I've made?

**4. :fas-info-circle: Questions regarding completing Increment A-TextUiTesting for ip**

As the title suggests, I'm a bit unsure on what counts as completion for the Increment A-TextUiTesting for the individual project. Are we supposed to include multiple test cases with different possible user inputs and their respective expected outputs? Or is it sufficient to test the initial expected output once the program is run without any user input?

From the instructions on the website for Week 2, all it states is
> Test using the I/O redirection technique
> Use the input/output redirection technique to semi-automate the testing of Duke.

with a link to a tutorial of the technique as well as stating where to find the required scripts in the Duke repo (the [text-ui-test](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/ip/tree/master/text-ui-test) folder).

For context, the following is my initial expected output once I run my chatbot:

Seems to work fine as per the User Guide for the most part but as @cth06-Github mentioned, the example given under the instructions in the user guide for creating an event task is the same as the one for creating a deadline task (as seen in the image below).

You might want to change that so that the user is clear on how to use the event command to create a new event.

- Your `TaskList.mark()` method is expecting a `Task` object, but it is receiving a `String` instead.
- This could mean that the way your program is parsing and storing tasks is incorrect.
- The `execute()` method in `BasicCommand` is trying to mark a task as done but is mistakenly handling a `String` instead of a `Task`.

Look at `TaskList.java:56`, where the error occurs. It likely contains something like:

'''java
public void mark(int index) ``{``
    Task task = (Task) tasks.get(index); // Potential issue
    task.markAsDone();
``}``

'''

- Make sure `tasks.get(index)` actually returns a `Task`, not a `String`.
- If `tasks` is an `ArrayList&lt;String>`, that would explain the issue.
- `tasks` should be an `ArrayList&lt;Task>`.

✅ **Fix:** Ensure `tasks` is correctly declared:

'''java
private ArrayList&lt;Task> tasks;

'''

If `tasks` contains `String`s instead, you may need to parse them into `Task` objects before storing them.

Look at how commands are being processed. If the `mark` command is treating task descriptions as `String` instead of `Task`, update it.

Example of a wrong approach:

'''java
public static Command parse(String input) ``{``
    if (input.startsWith("mark")) ``{``
        return new BasicCommand(input.substring(5)); // Wrong if input is stored as a String
    ``}``
``}``

'''

✅ **Fix:** Ensure the index is parsed properly:

'''java
public static Command parse(String input) ``{``
    if (input.startsWith("mark")) ``{``
        int index = Integer.parseInt(input.substring(5)) - 1; // Adjusting for zero-based index
        return new BasicCommand(index);
    ``}``
``}``

'''

- Make sure `BasicCommand` correctly stores an `int` index, not a `String`.

Look at `BasicCommand.java:21`, where it crashes. It likely tries to mark a task as done.

'''java
public void execute(TaskList tasks, Ui ui, Storage storage) ``{``
    tasks.mark((Task) taskIndex); // Wrong type
``}``

'''

✅ **Fix:** Make sure `taskIndex` is an `int`, not a `Task`:

'''java
public void execute(TaskList tasks, Ui ui, Storage storage) ``{``
    tasks.mark(taskIndex); // Now taskIndex is an int, no casting needed
``}``

'''

I would recommend you to transfer to a local machine

- **Transfer Your Project**
    - Use `scp` or `rsync` to copy your project files from the cluster to your local machine.
    - Example command to transfer files from the SoC cluster to your local machine:
        
        '''lua
        lua
        CopyEdit
        scp -r your_username@soc-ssh-address:/path/to/project /local/path/
        
        '''
        
    - Alternatively, if you have Git set up, just commit your changes and clone the repository on your local machine.
- **Set Up a Local Development Environment**
    - Install **Java** (ensure it matches the version used on the cluster).
    - Install **Gradle** (or use the Gradle wrapper `./gradlew`).
    - Install **IntelliJ IDEA** (highly recommended for Java projects).
- **Run Your Tests Locally**
    - Navigate to the project directory and execute:
        
        '''bash
        bash
        CopyEdit
        ./gradlew clean test
        
        '''

To test the saving function that you implemented at Level-7, you need to ensure that your program correctly writes and reads data from the save file. 

Since your implementation should persist data across multiple runs, you need to test the program twice to verify that the saved data is correctly loaded.

- **First Run**: Provide an input that adds tasks and saves them.
- **Second Run**: Run the program again to check if the previously saved tasks are loaded correctly.

Your existing `runtest.bat` runs a single test using:

'''bat
java -classpath ..\bin Duke &lt; input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT

'''

You can modify it to run the test twice with different input files:

'''bat
REM First run: Adding tasks and saving them
java -classpath ..\bin Duke &lt; inputSave.txt > ACTUAL_SAVE.TXT

REM Second run: Checking if tasks are loaded correctly
java -classpath ..\bin Duke &lt; inputList.txt > ACTUAL_LOAD.TXT

REM Compare expected outputs
FC ACTUAL_SAVE.TXT EXPECTED_SAVE.TXT
FC ACTUAL_LOAD.TXT EXPECTED_LOAD.TXT

'''
- `inputSave.txt` should contain commands to add tasks.
- `inputList.txt` should contain a `list` command to check if tasks persist.
- `EXPECTED_SAVE.TXT` should contain the expected output after saving.
- `EXPECTED_LOAD.TXT` should contain the expected output after reloading.

To ensure a clean slate before running the test, you should delete any existing save file before the first test run. You can do this using:

'''bat
del data\duke.txt

'''
or within your Java test setup.

If you are using JUnit, implement a `@BeforeEach` method in `Test.java` to clear the save file before each test:

'''java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class DukeTest ``{``
    @BeforeEach
    void clearSaveFile() throws IOException ``{``
        File saveFile = new File("data/duke.txt");
        if (saveFile.exists()) ``{``
            new FileWriter(saveFile, false).close(); // Clears file contents
        ``}``
    ``}``
``}``

'''

Alternatively, you can implement a `clear` command in your bot that clears saved data and include it as the first command in `inputSave.txt`.

The `SuppressionXpathSingleFilter` trick seems like the best fix for now since it stops false positives for lambda-style switch statements while keeping checks for conventional ones. But it does suppress **all** indentation rules inside lambda switch blocks, which might hide real issues.

Do you think there's a way to limit it to just `caseIndent`? Or maybe we should rethink enforcing `caseIndent` at all, since lambda switch statements are becoming more common?

Curious if anyone found a cleaner fix!

I think this is due to the fact that `rating` can be `null`. That is, you could theoretically pass in `null` as an argument in the constructor of `Review`, thus making a `Review` with `rating` set to null.

In situations like these, a multiplicity of `0..1` might be more appropriate since there is nothing strictly stopping an attribute from taking the value of `null`. (or there is the **possibility** of the attribute taking on the value of `null`)

Hi profs,

One of the bugs fixed required quite a few LoC to be changed. From manual counting, the actual functional code would be within the 10% limit. 

The issue is that because of cosmetic issues like the line being >120chars forcing me to add a line break, or a new public method added requiring javadocs which adds >=3 lines, the LoCs affected is a lot greater. Just wanted to ask how strict the LoC 10% limit is for cases like this.

If I understand correctly, the regex `&hat;[a-z]+(\.[a-z][a-z0-9]``{``1,``}``)*$` found in checkstyle.xml for package naming conventions requires the "main" package to only have lowercase letters while subpackages can have any lowercase letter or digit. 

I'm just curious about this, as nowhere in the style guide does it say package names can't have digits, as dictated by the `&hat;[a-z]+`. Is this missing in the guide, or should we avoid using digits? This rule isn't enforced in the checkstyle but issues a warning instead.

One of the week3 tasks is organising your classes into packages, you should probably take a look at that! TBH I think where you're at there's not too many files that dividing it up makes sense but down the line a package for tasks and its children, one for exceptions, one for UI would be worth considering.

Before I do so, I just want to check if this is OK and if there are any citations I need to make for both coding and non coding parts. I have read the policy on the course website but I believe it only covers code and not non code components.

Thanks

TLDR: Is it ok to use AI for user stories, feature specification, documentation, etc and if so, how do I cite it?

I used o1, o3-mini, and Gemini Experimental to write most(90%+) of my code. I noticed that AI is very good for coding up new functionality especially for a fairly simple project like this, but it is not great for debugging especially when it comes to tooling or function specific issues.

Are you calling setGraphic(new ...) a lot in your cell factory's updateItem
method? This method is called very frequently, its best to keep it thin

My guess is that the flickering is caused by a slow re-rendering of the
cells, handled by updateItem. This method is called pretty much anytime the
appearance of the ListView is changed, hence it's important to keep it thin
and not give that method too much work.

Your PersonCard constructor pulls quite a few images from resources. Can
you see if removing them and replacing them with simpler nodes like a Label
does the trick?

One last thing to try from me is to move the constructor out of updateItem
itself. When a person is created, the card should be made once, and a
reference stored somewhere; updateItem should extract the card from its
argument

But I do know cases where this can cause undesired behaviour, so tread
carefully

It seems like your magic bug happens only on your device LOL, maybe its
alright to leave it

I've asked Copilot AI and it suggest I manually delete the .class files from the master branch first but I feel like that's not really a good practice. How should I resolve binary file conflict?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Advice on testing static methods?**
</div>

im trying to write junit tests for a class with some static methods but its difficult bc how do i get consistent results for global variables and such. upon consulting chatgpt, i came across Mockito/PowerMockito as a solution for mocking static methods, but I'm curious if anyone here has had experience with this approach? 

has anyone tried (& succeeded) to test static methods using PowerMockito or Mockito? did you have to switch to JUnit 4 to use PowerMockito?

did you test it with some other methods? any best practices or alternatives you could recommend for testing static methods?

appreciate any insights or advice yall can provide!

THANKS!!

Hii, as the others hv mentioned already: static constants should generally be declared inside a class or interface in Java. This is generally for encapsulation purposes.

However, sometimes if u have shared constants and mutiple classes need access to a specific constant or other constants, then you can make a utility class that's final, to prevent inheriting & modifying the variables within it. Just thought this might come handy for things like relative file paths, to keep your code succinct! atbbb 👍

This is my gui for the Viktor chatbot, inspired by the hit show Arcane. 

2 things i've added beyond the requirements is randomised responses to echo user when adding tasks and changing image of bot (simpler stand-in for different emotions when responding to different commands)

I initially used Copilot for auto-completion, which sped up iP increments but required constant verification to ensure I understood the code. When I got complacent, later parts referencing AI-generated code caused issues.

Copilot’s monthly limit also ran out fairly quickly, so I tried Codeium. While its autocomplete is weaker, it has these beta features like refactoring and code generation from comment but I’m cautious about overusing it, as it sometimes overcomplicates methods. Its Javadoc-writing function is particularly helpful tho because it reduces tediousness & also assists with commit bodies.

Uniquely ( i think), I also used Character.AI to refine Viktor’s persona By interacting with an AI Viktor, I could analyze his speech patterns, tone, and responses in various scenarios, helping me make my chatbot feel more authentic.

The object diagram has 1 Chair and 1 Table which are associated.

For the first choice, 2 associations are drawn:
1. Between chair and table: each Table can have 0 or 1 Chair, which the object diagram complies with
2. Between table and table, but the * suggests that there can be any number (including 0), so the object diagram having no such association also complies.

For the last choice, the deciding link is the association between Table and Door. Multiplicity label states that each Table must have exactly 1 Door, but the object diagram's Table has no such Door.

(Please correct me if I'm wrong)

Why do you need this dependency? I thought I didn't need because ProgressWatcher implements Watcher, so the dependency is implicitly there in the form of a solid black line.

If ProgressWatcher needs this dependency, why doesn't UIWidget need this dependency from Activity too?

Also, when do I know if I need to put navigability? Because I thought that for the composition from activity to itself, we need navigability too.

So am I right to assume that as long as the sum of all my commit "+" is &lt;= 10% of my total code count at the end of iteration v1.6 I am safe?

I looked at your build.gradle it appears you do not have the javafx dependencies included?

I am aware that merge nodes can be omitted, but if you refer to the larger diagram, it is ambiguous if this is a branch or a merge because of the lack of an arrow

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34ed5a3d-64f1-4014-a00d-6544669fde76)

Maybe it's just missing an arrow to show the merge at this point?

Even when merge nodes are omitted in the textbook, they show arrows.

I agree with @damithc that aggregation, composition, and multiplicity are labels used to describe an association.

From the textbook, aggregation is a weaker relationship than composition. In this case, determining whether the relationship is aggregation or composition depends on two key questions:
- Can the Square objects exist independently of the Board?
In other words, does the Board object not own the Square objects?
For example, if the Square objects can be reused elsewhere (e.g., as standalone objects for writing answers on exam papers), then the relationship is aggregation.
- Are the Square objects created and managed exclusively by the Board?
If the Square objects cannot exist without the Board and are tightly coupled to it, then the relationship is composition.

In my opinion, the relationship here is more likely composition because the Square objects are an integral part of the Board and do not make sense outside of it. The Board creates, manages, and owns the Square objects, which aligns with the definition of composition.

Hope this helps! :)

Hi, tested on Windows.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c6a4a81-1928-4e9e-a84b-00fff5369012)

Works well overall no errors.

However I think got some bugs for Storage.

Though the Storage will save the list during previous launch, if I launch the application again and type list, the data file becomes empty.

Before typing list:

Bugs: App hanged when not entering in the specified datetime format for deadline, command used: deadline something /by now
Potential bugs: -Although empty description is handled correctly, description consisting of only spaces is accepted, i.e. todo followed with multiple spaces will create a todo with description "   "
-Datetime does not seem to be handled in event
-Error message when trying to delete when there's nothing to delete says: "Error: Invalid task number! Use 1-0"

Other than that, looks good!

**2. :fas-info-circle: Question about Feature Flaw Mentioned in Planned Enhancement**
</div>

Hi, may I ask whether it is reasonable to argue that a product has a severe feature flaw for missing an important feature despite the absence of the feature is mentioned in the Planned Enhancement?

For more context, the team I tested supports adding multiple `preference` to a customer. However, they do not support any edit or removal of the preference. The team rejected this Feature Flaw by arguing that they put “Support Deletion of Customer Preferences” as one of the planned enhancements, but in my opinion it is not reasonable for a CRUD application to have missing U and D in the first place. It makes the Application largely unusable as the only way to revert any error in adding preference is to clear all entries and build up the address book from scratch. May I check whether that is a valid reason for me to argue that the bug should be accepted instead?

Thank you in advance!

**1. :fas-info-circle: Faulty issues on CATcher in Testers Response Phase**
</div>

3 of my issues are faulty. I think the reason they're faulty might be because I continued to edit my choice of which bugs to trim about 1 hour after the deadline, because I saw that the CATcher page still allowed me to. Sorry for doing that. 

Also, the devs didn't reply to 3 of the 6 issues that I can see now on CATcher, and responded to 3 issues that i can't see on CATcher. What should I do about this?

**1. :fas-info-circle: practice paper p2 p2.16**
</div>

Hi, I was wondering why the answer is none of the above due to the loop. Since there is no conditional statements within the loop, I thought it wouldn't matter how many times the loop would iterate and we can treat as an arbitrary block of code, and thus the number of test cases required for path coverage would depend on the if statement at line 2?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7547b6ba-f499-462a-bb0e-4455f5687b01)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4246b31-def3-4e6d-a123-5a2a1e302f32)

based on the textbook definition, wouldn't the paths be `enter->2->4->exit` and `enter->2->6->exit`?

**OS**
Windows

Most of the program works as expected, so I'll just raise up the points which seemed weird

1. Some logic error with `/from, /to, /by` allowing me to create empty tasks

| ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfabae79-02eb-4395-9d60-3c9f4fe9894f) | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d81c816-90d8-4640-bc9f-7fbd979df29d) |
|----------------------------|------------------------|

2. Event allows me to create tasks with an earlier end date than start date (see 5)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9bd0912-6145-49ca-bd3d-be528ef80914)

3. Not sure if its intended or not, but I can't send some invalid commands like `mark one`, `delete`
4. Not a major problem but you could consider being more specific in the explanation of swapping / for - in your user guide to either switch all or switch none.

I think in `Friday.java`:
'''java
public void run() ``{``
        Ui.greet();
        boolean isExit = false;

        while (!isExit) ``{``
            try ``{``
                String fullCommand = ui.readCommand();
                ui.showLine();
                Command c = Parser.parse(fullCommand);
                c.execute(tasks, ui, storage);
                isExit = c.isExit();
            ``}`` catch (DukeException e) ``{``
                ui.showError(e.getMessage());
            ``}`` finally ``{``
                ui.showLine();
            ``}``
        ``}``
    ``}``
'''
Since there is no `bye` instruction specified in your `input.txt`, the ui does an additional read for the next command (but there isn't any). Which causes the scanner to crash.

Application launches but when using the command list it throws an error. even after adding new items to the list it is still throwing an error. Perhaps there is a problem with creating the storage file as no new data directory was created, neither was there a new save file.

Hi keyansheng. Like what Farhan has mentioned, the static constant should be declared inside the class.
Implicitly declared classes allow the static constant to be defined outside a class and still used in the class.
It is a preview feature in Java 21, which is out of the scope of this module.

'''java

It was likely meant to be written as:

I would think `Event`s are something that run `from` date `to` date, whereas these `LimitedTask`s are open `from` date `to` date. In implementation, maybe both of these types of tasks will be pushed to the top when running `list` to alert the user of important tasks in this current point of time. In terms of functionality, maybe 

- `Event` can only be marked as complete after `to`, 
- `LimitedTask` can only be marked after `from`, and might have additional alerts if it is still unmarked after `to`

Maybe they could both extend from the same class / interface, since both would have the `to` and `from` fields.

Jar file works as expected.
Some lag occasionally happened when I kept adding tasks. I'm not sure if it was my computer's problem.

What I think is that `s` must be created before `c` so that it can be passed in as a parameter. As mentioned in the textbook, time flows from top to bottom, so `s` should appear above `c`

Hello Bryce, in github pull request and issues share the same sequence of number when ordering them. Hence your issue 1 and 2 are not missing: it is just they are PRs so they don't appear when you search for issues. Hence if you search for closed PRs, you will see PR 1 and 2.

My operation system is Windows 10. most commands work well on my device. Task list are correctly saved in local devices as well.
 potential issues:
-When time format input is wrong, bot does not respond
-When input 'bye', the programme does not quit, and user can still interact with PerryGPT

Hi, I ran into this issue too when running the script in VSCode. Try making sure you’re running the script while in the `text-ui-test` folder as the paths are relative. Additionally, I believe you should try running the batch file (`runtest.bat`) instead as you are on a Windows environment, as noted in this [tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/textUiTesting.html) linked in the website.

Hi Bryce, this is because in your search bar, you have limited your search to only show issues (`is:issues`). The issues tab also includes pull requests, which happens to be issues 1 and 2 in your repository.

i believe its because for the instructors variable, the data type is an implementation of the solution (even without specifying its data type you can see the association between Instructor and Course classes, whereas for the isCoordinator boolean variable, it is needed to depict the domain, without which the coordinator association is not shown.

Tested on Windows. As mentioned, certain special symbols are not loading properly. Apart from that UI looks good. Basic functionality tested. 

Just typing "delete", "find", "mark" or "unmark" on their own without specifying any description or number prevents the message from being sent and exceptions are thrown in the command prompt (Refer to image below). Not sure if this is an intended feature but application still runs smoothly despite the exceptions.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on Branch and Merge nodes in Activity Diagrams**
</div>



![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24efe00a-e265-4106-8c7d-e2265d74de07)

This image shows that if a branch node is being used, there must be subsequent usage of a merge node. However, I just noticed that here:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32c1e52e-d909-4523-a9b5-6f293fa59003)

The branch node for the last else condition (beside [i &lt; 10]) does not have a subsequent merge node. Does that mean that the merge node is not always needed? 

Note: I'm aware that the textbook says the "Omitting the merge node if it doesn't cause any ambiguities" is allowed but I just want to clarify that if this statement actually means that the merge node need not be used following a branch node.

Thank you in advance!

I think this is an interesting issue because it is technically due to a cosmetic issue that causes the use case to seem incorrect.

## Why it could be `severity.VeryLow`

- The formatting issue doesn't change the **functionality** or **logic content** of the use case itself.
- All intended information is still present, and a reader / developer who is familiar with use case structure can still **infer the intended meaning**.
- In that sense, it aligns with the definition of `severity.VeryLow`:  
  > "A flaw that is purely cosmetic and does not affect usage."

## Why it could also be seen as `severity.Low`

- Use cases are meant to clearly distinguish between **main flow**, **extensions**, and **exceptional conditions**.
- The incorrect formatting (e.g. “Extensions” embedded within step 4, and unclear indentation of 3a1) **blurs the logic hierarchy**.
- This could **confuse readers unfamiliar with the content**.
- That aligns with `severity.Low`:  
  > "A flaw that causes minor inconvenience and may affect interpretation."

## Final Thoughts

However, I think I lean towards  `severity.VeryLow` as we are familiar with the use case structure as developers. I think the question to ask is whether you could understand what was going on when reading this use case. If you could understand it but it was not cosmetically pleasing when reading it then I think  `severity.VeryLow` is the correct label.

But don't just base your answer to the team off my opinion and maybe wait for the other's perspectives too!

Hi! So I believe the reason there is a dependency comes from this line [Sorry for the poor image quality]:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2ad3c41-b338-476b-80cf-5ebe982826f1)

> why there is dependency between progressWatcher and activity?

From the underlined portion here, we can see when creating ```watchers``` in `Activity`, it actually does _depend_ on the static field `MAX` in `ProgressWatcher`. That's why there is a dependency here.

> is dependency redundant since progressWatcher implements Watcher and Watcher has association with Activity?

This isnt technically the official definition but I like to think of dependencies as weak associations because of that we can't really say the dependency is redundant as we have to capture the full associations of the class diagram i.e.  `Activity` needing `MAX` in `ProgressWatcher`. 

Hope this helps! (Sorry if any part seems unclear)

**1. :fas-info-circle: MainWindowTest and HelpWindowTest cause runtime error during Codecov checks**
</div>

I did some changes in HelpWindow.java. 

There was no HelpWindowTest.java so i created one. It was working locally just fine but failed when i pushed it to github.

I disabled it and runtime error disappeared. However, the Codecov coverage is now back to 0% again (Codecov requires me to do testing of those parts of code I edited)

What should I do? Should I forgo the test and merge despite Codecov check failing because 0% coverage (will I be penalised for that)? Or should I indirectly test HelpWindow.java in some other tests and if so then where to test?

testing from macos
mostly looks good, havent found major bugs.d
potential bug: for events, can set /from to be after /to
small possible area for improvement, would it be better to add why command fails (eg when i dont put description in "deadline /by 2015-01-01", it just says "not a valid command", but could say something like "description is missing")

I believe there should only be one end node, so both `Door unlock` and `Door disabled` should be connected to the same end node (correct me if i am wrong, thanks!). Other than that, it looks good to me

**OS**: macOS

**Summary**: Pretty similar to previous testers, everything works fine except the 'deadline' command, which works with a different date format, which causes some inconsistency with the other task formats. I'm also unable to add time to deadlines along with the date (screenshot attached). Saving and reloading of tasks also works fine. 


### Screenshots of commands:


### Test `todo` command

I had a similar confusion at first, and your point about projectMembers not being "members" without the project makes total sense. But from what I understand, in UML, composition is more about object lifecycle and ownership, not just the role something plays.

So even though a person is called a “project member” in context, they can still exist independently of the project (unlike project tasks, which usually don’t make sense outside the project they’re part of). That’s why the diagram shows a regular association for Person and composition for Task.

That said, I’d still like more clarification if I’m misunderstanding anything since this distinction can be pretty subtle.

I'm not sure about the causes/intended fixes etc. But this is a known issue and could be fixed by just removing the three I/O redirection tests.

> I think https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html this might help. You can look on how to install/switch to the Java version specified for this course. I think the instructions on this are quite self-explanatory, hope this helps!

Changing the order of path with this guide worked to change the version of my console, thanks!
As for the jar file, it used to show a java exception has occured, but I reinstalled the 17.0.7 JDK and solved the issue.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Failed to write running test case event the class being tested works**
</div>

When I was writing test cases for `SearchEventCommandParser.java` which has similar structure as other `Parser` class, it failed passing the test cases even the `Predicate` contained by the class are the same.

The following picture shows the difference between expected and actual object.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8318029-fac6-4718-9922-1796940dbc72)

The following picture shows the `Predicate` contained in these classes are the same regarding `eventName`, `startTime` and `endTime`

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5426806-86fc-4601-9873-2ffc83a4a065)

Below is the code for `SearchEventCommand#equals()`

```
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) ``{``
        if (other == this) ``{``
            return true;
        ``}``

        if (!(other instanceof SearchEventCommand)) ``{``
            return false;
        ``}``

        SearchEventCommand otherCommand = (SearchEventCommand) other;
        return predicate.equals(otherCommand.predicate);
    ``}``
```

Has anyone met with the same issue?

Can anyone indicate some potential issues here?

Can anyone suggest some potential common issue for writing test cases? (To be avoided in the future)

Personally, I don't think it should be considered a constant. Cause it's tied to an instance and not the class itself. As for the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, since it's should be used for static final, it should not apply here.

Hi Prof @damithc, a few questions about this diagram

1. Is the dependency arrow from Section to Handout necessary here since the composition relationship already implies a dependency

2. Can Heading be just listed as an attribute of Handout when the instruction is to show associations as lines

3. Would omitting the multiplicity for the 'closest' relationship be a mistake since it is unknown if the multiplicity is 0..1 or compulsory

That's such a peculiar git behavior.

I would probably click the "terminal" button and run (instead of just clicking the "fetch" or "pull" button):

```
git fetch
git branch --all
```

Hi Prof, 

For the MVP submission on week 6, do we need to have additional features on top of the basic features of AB3 in our MVP feature list submission for week 6? I.e. is add, delete and list student information enough for our MVP feature list for now?

Side note: our team is planning to implement an address book to keep track of tutors' students information

From the textbook:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3d75ff1-7aff-4061-a5cb-36497c95bb80)

I assume that by "any number," you meant `*`. I believe we cannot assume the multiplicity to be `*` or `1` as the actual implementation may have a specific multiplicity.

For example, consider class A and class B such that class A has exactly two instances of B.

'''java
class A ``{``
    B b1;
    B b2;
``}``
'''

The following UML diagram is still correct, but assuming the multiplicity is `*` or `1` would be incorrect.

I believe SLAP doesn't contradict the idea of avoiding deep nesting. While I don't think SLAP will help with reducing the number of layers of abstraction/nesting (the complexity of the code will still be present, hidden within separate methods), SLAP gives you the flexibility to exit the nesting once you've reached a level of abstraction that helps you understand how the code works.

In deeply nested code, you often need to read through each line and explore the innermost sections to understand it. However, with the SLAP approach, the code can be refactored into smaller methods at different abstraction levels, and well-named and well-documented methods at the higher levels will usually offer enough context to grasp the logic, saving you the effort of tracing the lower nested layers.

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡[for WSL users] Dont run your project from IntelliJ using a windows path!**
</div>

I was wrestling with my iP and Gradle just not working for two days. Nothing worked, even building from terminal didn't work, the gradlew binary simply could not be run by bash despite chmod +x and other attempts.

Finally after two days I realised the issue - I had configured by project under intellij using the native windows path to WSL i.e. `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-24.04\home\...` , so any files or binaries that intellij had been producing were produced as windows files, with the `\r` carriage return. After running `dos2unix` on my entire iP directory, things were fixed!

I realised I should have run IntelliJ in "remote mode" (exactly how VSCode does it), where it sets up a server on the remote machine, in this case WSL (there is a separate selection for this), and uses a client-server model to function instead. Interestingly, IntelliJ's remote mode is buggy and slow, while VSCode's one is basically flawless - I would have expected more out of a tool that costs so much but oh well that's two days wasted

Exploring further, looks like it's a [known issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-341365). What seems even worse is that writing the path as `\\wsl$\...` instead of `\\wsl.localhost\...` fixes things, so I'm not sure why IntelliJ suggested the first path in the first place when I was setting up the project...

According to how the course website arranges the topics, I see association as a general, umbrella term that includes both aggregation and composition. Association is the _fundamental relationship_, while aggregation/composition are _specialized forms_ of it, adding extra constraints to specify ownership and lifecycle rules. 

To answer your first question - yes, it can be considered to be either aggregation or composition (but not both) as you are stating a more specific association. However, to determine which of the 2 will be based on how you see the question. Personally, I think they are a _"whole-part" relationship_ as the `Square`s would not exist without a `Board` holding them together. So in this scenario, I would incline more towards composition than aggregation.

Moving on to your second question. I agree with @damithc that association cannot be replaced entirely because then, we would be seeing association and aggregation/composition as 2 totally different concepts when they are in fact "superclass/subclass" of each other.

Hope this helps!

The behaviour suggests that Handout A can reference to Brochure A, which can have the cover Handout A, and to Brochure B, which can have the cover Handout B. If the arrow is bidirectional this means Brochure B must have the cover Handout A if Handout A can reference Brochure B, which does not match the intended behaviour. So it's best to draw it as 2 unidirectional arrows

Hi im not sure if this would affect or fix your issue but you might want to check IntelliJ settings to see if the Gradle JVM is set to the correct version.
Click on IntelliJ IDEA -&gt; Settings -&gt; Build, Execution, Deployment -&gt; Build Tools -&gt; Gradle.

Under Build and run: check if both build and run using and run test using Gradle

Under Gradle: Check if Gradle JVM selected is
zulu-17 Azul Zulu 17.0.11 - aarch64

Your version number may differ but should be Java 17

Hmm i think personally this depends on preference? For example, the given excerpt can also be written like:

```
    @Test
    public void intDivision_nonZeroDivisor_success_1() throws Exception ``{``
        // normal division results in an integer answer 2
        assertEquals(2, new IntPair(4, 2).intDivision());
    ``}``

    @Test
    public void intDivision_nonZeroDivisor_success_2() throws Exception ``{``
        // normal division results in a decimal answer 1.9
        assertEquals(1, new IntPair(19, 10).intDivision());
    ``}``

    @Test
    public void intDivision_nonZeroDivisor_success_3() throws Exception ``{``
        // dividend is zero but devisor is not
        assertEquals(0, new IntPair(0, 5).intDivision());
    ``}``
```
which also works out.

The first method is more succinct while the second one provides a bit more clarity.

To add on, antiviruses sometimes raise false-positives on programs you're working on (especially if they involve I/O or system calls). 

If the antivirus has already acted you should be able to recover the affected file from quarantine through the antivirus application, after which you can add the project folder as an exclusion to prevent further misdetections. Every antivirus has a different interface so its best to consult the respective guides on how to do so. For example, [this is the guide for Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v3672136).

To add on to what was discussed, Deep-Nesting and Abstraction are not similar in one key aspect: Deep-nesting by definition recursively inherits scope. This means at a certain point/LoC there can be many different variables or calculations happening in context that makes reasoning about code behavior and thus debugging difficult. A related paradigm for classes is the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/principles.html#single-responsibility-principle).

Furthermore, when using an IDE like Intellij IDEA, the navigation between functions is handled very elegantly — especially for runtime debugging. Combined with the significant benefits of Abstraction for codebase maintainability, there is a very strong motivation to use Abstraction wherever applicable.

I think in this case, it might be okay to infer that for the "Box box" parameter in the Lid class is referring to a box object the lid is for. It would not make sense for the Lid class to be referring to another Box object because then it would be an "infinite" series of Box and Lid objects. Therefore lets say the comments were omitted, it would be okay to deduce that the "Box box" parameter in the Lid class is referring to the Box object the Lid is for.

Hi prof, i have a few questions about loc
1. are loc counted by only additions or both additions and deletions (1 line changed would be counted 1 addition + 1 deletion)
2. is the loc counted by the overall pr or per commit (eg. commit 1 10 line changes, commit 2 10 lines changes but overall pr is 6 line changes)
3. should we prioritise java SE conventions or fixing bugs (bug requires exceeding loc if java conventions are followed but also fixable within loc by violating some conventions
thanks

@damithc Hi Prof, 

Just wanted to clarify a few things regarding the 10% and 2% LoC limit:

1) Is the 2% margin meant specifically for functional code changes (what is counted as functional?), or does it include cosmetic lines (e.g., line wrapping, javadocs, etc.) as well?

2) Do changes to images (e.g., updating UI screenshots, diagrams, .puml) count towards the LoC limit?

3) Lastly, how severe is the penalty if we slightly exceed the limit due to necessary fixes? Just trying to better understand the trade-offs before making the call.

Need help deciding which bugs to choose. 

Is it better to choose a bug that is 

A.
an extremely clear-cut error, e.g. a typo
so it should be `response.Accepted` but **verylow** severity. 

B.
an error that is valid but not important, e.g. missing some information in error message
so it should be `response.NotInScope` but **low** severity.

Basically, do we go for higher severity or higher degree of acceptance?

**1. :fas-info-circle: runtest.sh - javac command not found**
</div>

**Context/Issue**
error 'javac' command not found when running runtest.sh.
When i run javac Main.java on my files normally in my terminal it works fine, always has. Only when running javac in runtest.sh is it somehow unable to find the command.

runtest.sh file is unchanged, the original copy from website. (except main entry class name)

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# create bin directory if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "../bin" ]
then
    mkdir ../bin
fi

# delete output from previous run
if [ -e "./ACTUAL.TXT" ]
then
    rm ACTUAL.TXT
fi

# compile the code into the bin folder, terminates if error occurred
if ! javac -cp ../src/main/java -Xlint:none -d ../bin ../src/main/java/*.java
then
    echo "********** BUILD FAILURE **********"
    exit 1
fi

# run the program, feed commands from input.txt file and redirect the output to the ACTUAL.TXT
java -classpath ../bin Main < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT

# compare the output to the expected output
diff ACTUAL.TXT EXPECTED.TXT
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
    echo "Test result: PASSED"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Test result: FAILED"
    exit 1
fi
```


**Output**
```
text-ui-test/runtest.sh: line 16: javac: command not found
********** BUILD FAILURE **********
```

**Things I Have Tried**
I have already triple checked my environment variables - that java/bin is in PATH (+ it has always worked normally in my terminal, dk why .sh cannot)
I have tried running it in Command Prompt, Powershell and Bash (from within VSCode and externally). All of them result in the same error.
After consulting Google and ChatGPT, I tried manually setting the path using export PATH, directly putting in the file path to javac etc. but nothing has worked for me. As I lack knowledge on shell scripts and linux/windows environment differences I am struggling.

**System**
I am using Windows 11, I am using Visual Studio Code as my IDE. Just in case the IDE affects it I tried IntelliJ too but same error.

Nice! by the way for anyone else using VSCode or some other IDE where there’s no sync button you can run `gradlew build` in terminal to build the dependencies, and make sure it succeeds.

in my case my dependencies wouldn’t register because the build failed due to checkstyle errors. my check style had some annoying remaining errors and so my javafx dependencies didn’t get through, I didn’t want to deal with that yet so I commented it out to work on javafx first.

I tested your code on Windows 11 Java 23.0

the legal inputs work as intended, but it accepts garbage dates like 2025-02-29.
Your bot also gets stuck (or does completely nothing) for some illegal inputs like `delete A`

Improvements:
I like the UI and reminders functionality, would be great if there was a "help" command to list all command usage.
Another one is to tell user that task is already marked if user try to mark an already marked task.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Problems with input.txt file**

Hi guys

I was working on the `TextUiTesting` component of the project when my Norton antivirus suddenly quarantined and removed my `input.txt` file as seen below:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b23dff75-7048-496b-b93e-04ba615e6134)

When I tried creating a new `input.txt` file, I get the following error:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/430dd93a-1e7d-4f4d-bc1d-1367492806f1)

I have checked and the file does not exist anywhere else, and I am able to add all other files to the folder

I have also tried creating the file using git bash (with vim) but that resulted in me being unable to edit or delete the file, despite changing the permissions. (I eventually somehow removed the file but now I have a folder i cannot delete..)

Sorry if this is unclear! I can provide more clarifications if needed

You might be able to access your answer script by clicking the [HOME MENU] button on the top right of the screen in Examplify. Click on [Exam History] and log in. Not the most sure if it's available for the practice paper but I am able to access it for the mock exam. Hope this helps!

Hello! 

So sorry I was wondering if "giving potential reasons" is encouraged for reviewing pull requests. 

**For instance,** 
Instead of **"Perhaps a more intuitive variable name here?"**, we write **"Perhaps a more intuitive variable name here because... [one possible reason]"** 

I was wondering if this could provide further clarification for the author on the rationale (or potential reasons) behind the reviewer's comments / suggestions as well as offer another point of view on the perceiving the situation. 

Thank you!

@weiliann Thank you for testing it out and for the feedback! Really appreciate it :) 

The way I have coded it does not let you add the task if you used the timings in the past or at the current minute you were testing. So if the time when you were testing was 8pm then in the command you should have used 8.01pm  :)

**1. :fas-info-circle: Chatbot Stuck When Handling Exceptions in Gradle (IntelliJ)**

When I run my chatbot with Gradle in IntelliJ, it gets stuck when handling exceptions. It prints out the error message, but instead of waiting for me to type the next command, it just keeps loading, and I can't type anything. However, when I run it in the terminal without Gradle (by compiling and running the Java files directly), it works fine. Before implementing Gradle, everything is fine also. 

Why is this happening, and how can I fix it? Or is it supposed to be like this?

I agree with @Jovin-Ang and @codebreaker64 . A private final instance variable is not a constant in the same sense as a static final variable. The final keyword only ensures the reference cannot be reassigned, but it does not guarantee immutability. If the object itself is mutable, its state can still change. Since these variables are instance-specific and not shared across all instances, they should follow lowerCamelCase, while SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE should be reserved for static final constants

In the Test.java file i added a method with @BeforeEach (with import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach) which will be executed before each test case and within the method I checked if the file exist if it exist clear everything inside.

Or you can add a function to clear the file with clear being input to the bot then just make sure first line of the command is to clear the past data.

I have a question regarding the relations between duplicates. If a team flags:
- `A` as a duplicate of `C`, and 
- `B` as a duplicate of `C`, 

is `A` then considered a duplicate of `B`? 
For example: `A` and `B` are regarding specific bugs of the DG, but were flagged as duplicates of `C`, which generalized issues `A` and `B` into a single bug report `C`. Does the tester who submitted `A` and `B` not earn credit for the separate bugs despite them being different bugs?

It seems that even in the official Java SE 17 documentation, there are constant field values that are not static (namely in the [`com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule` module](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/constant-values.html#:~:text=com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule))

Therefore, I think it can be safe to say that final, non-static attributes can be considered as constants.

Receiving an email about a failed workflow suggests that your tests did not pass.  

I think you should be able to see a more detailed report of your test cases at:  
 **`../ip/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`**  

Your test is failing because an exception is being thrown, which is causing the test to fail.  
It would be better to use `assertThrows` to check if your exceptions are being thrown

The answer says that the lifeline for `s` should be higher than `c`, but I can't find where in the textbook it actually mentions this at all. The closest I can find is an object directly creating another object, but in this case it is not mentioned if `s` created `c`.

Does anyone know if this is mentioned in the textbook at all?

### Smoke Test
- The smoke test passes successfully on Windows: data is saved and the file is created as expected.

### Fixes / Recommendations
- **Task Numbering:**  
  The screenshot indicates an issue with incorrect numbering of tasks. Please review and adjust the numbering logic to ensure sequential order.

- **Default Priority:**  
  The default priority is set to P2. Consider exploring auto-prioritisation based on the closeness of the due date to better manage task urgencies.

Otherwise, LGTM.

I also did face this issue, but I resolved it by modifying the `expectedMessage` for the those tests. I replaced `editedPerson` with `Messages.format(editedPerson)` instead.

For instance,

I'm using Mac (ARM64) and it works. Tasks are saved properly and data file is created. Might want to relook at how the dialogbox resizes as the screen size is changed.

Tested on Mac
No errors occurred although DateTime parsing instructions are a bit vague
Overall, really nice UI! Good job.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Able to run ./gradlew test but shows error when i press the actual intellij button for dummy junit test**
</div>

As written in the title, im facing issues running the tests with the actual run button and also teh gradle sidebar, however, when i try and run ./gradlew test directly in the terminal, it seems to be working. I checked my file structure, sdk version, and i am using gradle by default to run the test so im not sure what seems to be the issue. Tried everything to troubleshoot but still can seem to solve the issue. Am a mac user.

for reference this is the error i faced:

You can use something like `File myFile = new File("data/Duke.txt")` to use a relative path.

For a better example on how to use this, you can refer to:

I think its because Foo also has an implementation of process(). So Bar inherits that method and can use it. process() is not declared as an abstract method in Foo.

Hello @huangtian666,

Testing on Mac Apple Silicon with Java Version 17.0.11

Upon testing, there seems to be an unhandled exception when I try to add a task with a date without any time specified.

Hello @huangtian666, 

I attempted to run this on my Macbook Pro M1 (2021) model (Apple Silicon), testing with Java Version 17.0.12.

I was greeted with the following error:

From experience, this is due to not having dependencies for Apple Silicon in the _build.gradle_ file. 
```
dependencies ``{``
    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.7'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac-aarch64'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'

    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.7.0")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.7.0")
``}``
```

Above is an excerpt from my file's dependency block, which has classifiers for `mac-aarch64` to allow my jar file to run on Mac OS with Apple Silicon chipsets. 

Hope this helps.

Works well on Windows with Java 17.0.12:

I used MacOS Silicon to run the jar file, and the similar error as Gaanesh came out as well. 

I think it can be explained by the different Javafx API version used by our machines. ChatGPT said that

I agree with Prof @damithc that as association cannot be _replaced_ by aggregation or composition.

As for whether to _add_ aggregation or composition, I guess it depends on the context.

If the `Board` and `Square` classes are part of a chess game, for example, then we can see that a `Board` cannot exist without multiple `Squares`, and so we can represent the _whole-part_ relationship by adding ___composition___ (__solid__ diamond) to the existing association.

If the `Board` represents just a plain board, and `Square` represents some square pieces, then this becomes a _container-containee_ relationship where the `Board` can still exist separately without any `Square`s. We can represent this relationship by adding ___aggregation___ (_unfilled_ diamond) to the existing associatoin.

This is based on my understanding. I could be mistaken here.

Hi! I've downloaded and tested your program.

From what I've seen it works as intended. One suggestion I have is to accept more date formats or indicate the format in the beginning.

Hi Wen Ting! I got the same issue as well! and I think @AnAfterthought might be right.

For me the error lied in
`private Image dukeImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/user.jpg")); `

when my folder was named `Image`

I agree with Keyansheng. But, in the context of CS2103, I will be more inclined to say it is severity very low

Hi @AbiHalim,

Faced a similar issue to the @NhatMinh0208 as above.

Running on windows 11

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c532be5-cea3-4ca4-93e9-e7732581cd4a)

Same issue when double clicking jar file. Could try checking your dependencies in build.gradle

**editing most recent commit**
- make sure you are in the correct branch and run this command `git commit --amend -m "new commit message..."`
- then run `git push --force-with-lease &lt;repository> &lt;branch>`

**editing older commits**
- run `git rebase -i HEAD~&lt;N>` N being number of commits to jump back
- editor will show up 
- change pick to reword (or edit) on the commit you want to modify
- edit the commit message and close the editor
- run `git rebase --continue`
- run `git push --force`

note: be careful when using `--force`, check out this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8981194/changing-git-commit-message-after-push-given-that-no-one-pulled-from-remote)

For the 'deadline' command, if u tried the yyyy-MM-dd format works, while formats with d m y in that order produce the problems as shown in the previous testers.

this is because the gradle provided by the module is not compatible with JDK21.
I think you need to check whether you have downloaded JDK17 or not first.
If you have downloaded, then you need to reconfigure your environment variable, change java home to the current address of your JDK17.
If you haven't download that, then download JDK17 first and do as above.
To check whether you have done, open a command line (powershell...) and input java --version to see if it's like:
java 17.0.14 2025-01-21 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.14+8-LTS-191)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.14+8-LTS-191, mixed mode, sharing)
and then go to your intelij to reset your project's java version at the same time.

**OS**
Linux

Works on Linux and valid inputs are handled correctly. I had the same issues as the above commenter (some invalid inputs like "delete" cannot be sent).

The task saving works correctly but the taskdata directory was created in the parent directory of the jar file, which is slightly different from what was specified on the user guide.
